 * The two halves have different subjects, which is the whole reason this page
 * can exist at all:
 *
 * - **Access level** is about the *group* resource — who may open and edit it.
 *   The server cascades it to the agents the group owns.
 * - **Editable settings** are about the *supervisor agent*, because a group
 *   conversation is a conversation with the supervisor: `useGroupContext`
 *   resolves the chat context's `agentId` to `supervisorAgentId`, so the group
 *   chat's model / execution-environment switcher reads exactly that row's
 *   policies. Deliberately NOT fanned out to the member agents — a workspace
 *   member has no per-member switcher to gate, and writing a `fixed` policy
 *   onto an agent with no execution target is rejected by `AgentModel`.
 *
 * The group store hydrates the supervisor into `agentMap` whenever group detail
 * loads (`agentGroup/action.ts`), so the shared agent hook has its row here.
