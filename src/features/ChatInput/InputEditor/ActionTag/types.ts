/**
 * Action tag architecture:
 *
 * 1. Command      — Built-in, line-start only (slash menu), executed client-side before send
 * 2. Skill        — Skill package, inserted via @ mention, preloaded before execution
 * 3. Tool         — Explicit tool selection, inserted via @ mention, context injected directly
 * 4. ProjectSkill — Filesystem skill discovered from the project or execution device,
 *                   inserted via slash menu, serialized as literal `/skill-name` so the
 *                   runtime resolves and runs the skill itself.
 * 5. AgentSkill   — Agent-document skill bundle from `agentDocumentService`; the runtime
 *                   resolves the chip's identifier (`agent-document:<filename>`) against
 *                   the agent's document store at preload time.
