 * reading them all is **where the section sits on Home** — you already know
 * which part of the page you want less of, so the panel is read by pointing at
 * it rather than by recalling a category name.
 *
 * That makes membership a fact about the page, not a taste call: the main
 * column carries the agent feeds and the two task blocks, and the rail carries
 * goals, news and suggestions (`RAIL_INBOX_PROPS` hides needs-you, running and
 * unread from the rail; `ownsRailSections` decides the rest). A widget that
 * moves columns must move groups with it.
 *
 * The order inside each group follows the page top-down, so scanning the panel
 * and scanning Home walk the same path.
