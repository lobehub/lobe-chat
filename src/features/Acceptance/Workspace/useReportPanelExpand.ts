 *
 * Master-detail only works while the detail still has room. The report body wants
 * ~880px and the list is 260–420px wide, so once the viewport drops under `lg` the
 * two can't sit side by side — the report gets squeezed into a column too narrow to
 * read. Below that width the list stops being a fixed column and becomes a float
 * overlay that is closed by default.
 *
 * The narrow-width collapse is deliberately NOT written back to
 * `showVerifyReportPanel`: that flag is the user's preference for the wide layout,
 * and clobbering it would leave the panel collapsed after they resize back — the
 * layout would have silently "remembered" a decision the user never made.
