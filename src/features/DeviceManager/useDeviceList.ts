/**
 * Workspace-aware device list. ALWAYS use this (not
 * `lambdaQuery.device.listDevices.useQuery`) for any surface that lists or
 * resolves devices: `useClientDataSWR` augments the cache key with the active
 * workspace id, so switching workspaces re-fetches into a fresh cache entry.
 * The raw TRPC React Query key has no workspace dimension — a list primed in
 * one workspace kept serving a stale pool after switching, and a
 * fetch primed while the workspace was still resolving stuck for the whole
 * session (the DeviceManager fix this generalizes).
 *
 * Devices come from an authed lambda procedure, so only query once signed in
 * (desktop always queries — it lists the local device's registered cwd).
 *
 * Refresh: `refreshDeviceList()` (`./const`) revalidates every workspace
 * context's entry; the returned `mutate` revalidates just the active one.
