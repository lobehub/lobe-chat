// `home` nav key, and on desktop `NavPanel` lives outside `TabHost` while the
// Home layout only mounts inside a home tab — and `Activity` unmounts effects
// for inactive tabs. Registering from the route layout leaves those tabs with
// no `home` entry at all, so the panel is stuck on the loading skeleton.
