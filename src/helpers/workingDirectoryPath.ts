 * config is treated as `github` (the only web-supported repo source); on desktop
 * it stays `undefined` so callers fall back to a live probe.
 *
 * No config at all means "nothing was ever persisted" — that must stay
 * `undefined` on every platform, otherwise a web caller would treat any bare
 * device cwd as a GitHub repo and fire git/PR probes at directories that were
 * never identified as one.
 *
 * Shared by the topic meta hover card and the ControlBar git status so both read
 * repoType from the same source instead of diverging.
