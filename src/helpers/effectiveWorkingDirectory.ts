/**
 * Resolve the agent's effective working directory: topic override first, then
 * the agent's per-device value. Returns an actual filesystem path, or
 * `undefined` when nothing is configured (or off-desktop).
 *
 * This is the single source behind both the `{{workingDirectory}}` system-prompt
 * placeholder and the working-directory handed to tools, so what the prompt
 * promises matches what tools actually operate on.
 *
 * The chat state is passed IN rather than read from `useChatStore` so this stays
 * importable from inside the chat store's own module graph (e.g. the agent-run
 * transports). Importing the store instance there would create a cycle
 * (chat store → agentRun actions → transport → here → chat store) and leave the
 * action classes undefined at module-eval time.
 *
 * Pass `topicId` for async work (e.g. a streaming tool call) so the directory is
 * bound to the topic that *started* the request, not whatever topic is active
 * now — the user may switch topics mid-stream. Omit it (prompt-build time) to
 * resolve against the active topic.
 *
 * Pass `agentId` when the caller has captured a specific agent (e.g. from the
 * operation context) so the agent-level fallback resolves against the
 * request-starting agent, not the currently active one.
