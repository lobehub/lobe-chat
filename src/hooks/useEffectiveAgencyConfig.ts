 * `workspace_user_settings.preference.agentDeviceOverrides[agentId]` and must
 * be merged over the shared row via `resolveAgentAgencyConfig` at read time.
 * Reading the shared row alone shows whichever device landed there (usually
 * the creator's machine) instead of this member's choice.
 *
 * The member policy applies only to public Workspace Agents, but the caller's
 * override merges for every workspace agent: managers and private-agent
 * owners also keep their `local` / this-machine pick in the override (the
 * shared row must never reference a personal device) — mirroring the write
 * side (`useSelectExecutionTarget`).

 * Self-populates the workspace preference cache (SWR dedupes across callers;
 * personal mode short-circuits without a network call).
