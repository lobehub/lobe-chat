 * Watch the open topic while it is parked as `scheduled` (rate-limit resume or
 * a deferred send) and pull the cron dispatch into the store when it happens.
 *
 * The dispatcher only writes to the DB — there is no push channel to a client
 * already sitting on the topic — so without this the stale rate-limit card,
 * the `scheduled` status and the missing stream all persist until an unrelated
 * SWR revalidation (blur→focus, reconnect) happens to refetch.
 *
 * Two triggers, one sync (`syncScheduledTopicRun`):
 * - on topic entry: an immediate check, catching a dispatch that happened
 *   while the topic wasn't open;
 * - around `runAt`: a 30s poll, armed just before the run is due. Far from
 *   `runAt` the "interval" is a single timer that lands at the window start,
 *   so an idle parked topic costs no recurring requests.
 *
 * Stops by itself: once the sync folds the dispatch in, the topic's status
 * leaves `scheduled` and the SWR key becomes null. From there
 * `useGatewayReconnect` (keyed off the synced `runningOperation`) attaches to
 * the live stream.
