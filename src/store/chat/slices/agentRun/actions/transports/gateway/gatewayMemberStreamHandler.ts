 * message nor the member rows — and without the council tool message the members
 * would render as a vertical stack instead of parallel columns. On the first

 * (`ensureGroupHydrated`, shared across members) so the council forms, then
 * stream content into the member row via targeted `updateMessage`. Because we
 * dispatch the full accumulated content (not deltas), any chunk that lands
 * before hydration completes is repainted once the row exists — self-healing.
