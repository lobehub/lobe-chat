## Testing Strategy

### 1. Zustand Store Action Testing Pattern

All store action tests should follow the patterns documented in:

- **Main Guide**: `@.cursor/rules/testing-guide/zustand-store-action-test.mdc`

Key principles:

- **Test Layering**: Only spy on direct dependencies, never cross layers
- **Per-Test Mocking**: Spy on-demand in each test, avoid global mocks
- **Act Wrapping**: Always wrap state updates with `act()`
- **Type Safety**: Ensure mock return types match actual service responses
- **SWR Hooks**: For SWR-based actions, mock `useSWR` globally and return data synchronously

### 1.1. Using Subagents for Efficient Testing

**When to use subagents**:

- Testing multiple action files in the same store/domain
- Large refactoring requiring tests for multiple files
- Parallel development of multiple features

**Subagent workflow**:

1. **One subagent per action file** - Each subagent focuses on testing ONE action file completely
2. **Independent verification** - Each subagent runs its own type-check, lint, and test verification
3. **No commits from subagents** - Only the parent agent creates the final commit after all subagents complete
4. **Parallel execution** - Launch all subagents in a single message using multiple Task tool calls
5. **Consolidate results** - Parent agent reviews all results, runs final verification, updates docs, and commits

**Example usage**:

Testing 3 files in discover store:

- Launch 3 subagents in parallel (one message with 3 Task calls)
- Each subagent writes tests for its assigned file
- Each subagent verifies its tests pass
- After all complete, run final checks and create one commit

**DO NOT**:

- Have subagents commit changes
- Have subagents update test-coverage.md
- Have subagents work on multiple files
- Create separate commits for each file

### 2. Testing Checklist

For each action file, ensure:

- [ ] Basic action tests (validation, main flow, error handling)
- [ ] Service integration tests (mocked)
- [ ] State update tests
- [ ] Selector tests (if complex selectors exist)
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Loading/abort state management
- [ ] Type safety (no @ts-expect-error unless necessary)

### 3. Store Organization Patterns

**Pattern 1: Simple Action File**

```
store/domain/slices/feature/
  ├── action.ts
  ├── action.test.ts
  ├── selectors.ts
  └── selectors.test.ts
```

**Pattern 2: Complex Actions (Subdirectory)**

```
store/domain/slices/feature/
  ├── actions/
  │   ├── __tests__/
  │   │   ├── action1.test.ts
  │   │   └── action2.test.ts
  │   ├── action1.ts
  │   ├── action2.ts
  │   └── index.ts
  └── selectors/
```

## Complete Testing Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Follow this complete workflow for every testing task. ALL steps are REQUIRED.

### Recommended: Use Subagents for Parallel Testing

For files with multiple action files to test, use the Task tool to create subagents that work in parallel:

**Workflow**:

1. **Identify all action files** that need testing in the target store/slice
2. **Launch one subagent per action file** using the Task tool
3. **Each subagent independently**:
   - Writes tests for ONE action file only
   - Runs type-check and lint
   - Verifies tests pass
   - Reports results back
   - **DOES NOT commit** (parent agent handles commits)
4. **After all subagents complete**, review all results
5. **Run final verification** (type-check, lint, tests)
6. **Update test-coverage.md** with combined results
7. **Create single commit** with all new tests

**Example subagent prompt**:

```
Write comprehensive tests for src/store/discover/slices/plugin/action.ts following @.cursor/rules/testing-guide/zustand-store-action-test.mdc.

Requirements:
1. Write tests covering all actions in the file
2. Follow SWR hooks testing pattern (if applicable)
3. Run type-check and lint to verify
4. Run tests to ensure they pass
5. Report back with:
   - Number of tests written
   - Test coverage areas
   - Any issues encountered

DO NOT:
- Commit changes
- Update test-coverage.md
- Work on other action files
```

**Benefits of subagents**:

- ✅ Parallel execution - multiple action files tested simultaneously
- ✅ Focused scope - each subagent handles one file completely
- ✅ Independent verification - each file gets type-check/lint/test verification
- ✅ Clean commits - single commit after all work is done
- ✅ Better organization - clear separation of concerns

### Step 0: Identify Missing Tests

```bash
# List all action files without tests
for file in $(find src/store -name "action.ts" | grep -v test | sort); do
  testfile="${file%.ts}.test.ts"
  if [ ! -f "$testfile" ]; then
    echo "❌ $file"
  fi
done
```

### Step 1: Development and Testing

```bash
# 1. Write tests following the testing guide
# 2. Run tests to verify they pass
bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' 'src/store/[domain]/slices/[slice]/action.test.ts'

# For actions in subdirectories:
bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' 'src/store/[domain]/slices/[slice]/actions/__tests__/[action].test.ts'
```

### Step 2: Type and Lint Checks

**CRITICAL**: Run type check and lint before proceeding. Failing these checks means the task is incomplete.

```bash
# Check TypeScript types (from project root)
bun run type-check

# Fix any linting issues
bunx eslint src/store/[domain]/ --fix
```

**Common Type Errors to Watch For:**

- Missing or incorrect type annotations
- Unused variables or imports
- Incorrect generic type parameters
- Mock type mismatches

**Do NOT proceed to Step 3 if type/lint checks fail!**

### Step 3: Run Coverage Report

```bash
# Run coverage to get updated metrics
bunx vitest run --coverage 'src/store'
```

### Step 4: Summarize Development Work

Before updating documentation, create a summary of what was accomplished:

**Summary Checklist:**

- [ ] What store/slice was worked on?
- [ ] What was the coverage improvement? (before% → after%)
- [ ] How many new tests were added?
- [ ] What specific features/logic were tested?
- [ ] Were any bugs discovered and fixed?
- [ ] Any new patterns or best practices identified?

**Example Summary:**

```
Store: chat/slices/aiChat
Coverage: 65% → 82% (+17%)
Tests Added: 52 new tests
Features Tested:
  - Message streaming with tool calls
  - RAG integration and chunk retrieval
  - Error handling for API failures
  - Abort controller management
Bugs Fixed: None
Guide Updates: Added streaming response mocking pattern
```

### Step 5: Update This Document

Based on your development summary, update the following sections:

1. **Current Status** section:
   - Update overall coverage percentage
   - Update test file count and total test count

2. **Coverage Status by Priority** section:
   - Move completed actions from missing tests to "Has Tests" section
   - Update the count of files with/without tests

3. **Completed Work** section:
   - Add newly tested actions to the list
   - Document coverage improvements
   - Document any bugs fixed

### Step 6: Final Verification

```bash
# Verify all tests still pass
bunx vitest run 'src/store'

# Verify type check still passes
bun run type-check
```

### Complete Workflow Example (Single File)

```bash
# 1. Development Phase
# ... write code and tests ...
bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' 'src/store/tool/slices/mcpStore/action.test.ts'

# 2. Type/Lint Phase (REQUIRED)
bun run type-check # Must pass!
bunx eslint src/store/tool/ --fix

# 3. Coverage Phase
bunx vitest run --coverage 'src/store'

# 4. Summarization Phase
# Create summary following the checklist above

# 5. Documentation Phase
# Update this file with summary and metrics

# 6. Final Verification
bunx vitest run 'src/store'
bun run type-check

# 7. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "✅ test: add comprehensive tests for mcpStore actions"
```

### Complete Workflow Example (Using Subagents)

**Scenario**: Testing all discover store slices (plugin, mcp, assistant, model, provider)

**Step 1: Launch Subagents in Parallel**

Create 5 subagents, one for each action file:

```typescript
// Launch all subagents in a single message with multiple Task tool calls
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Test plugin action',
  prompt: `Write comprehensive tests for src/store/discover/slices/plugin/action.ts following @.cursor/rules/testing-guide/zustand-store-action-test.mdc.

Requirements:
1. Write tests covering all actions (usePluginCategories, usePluginDetail, usePluginList, usePluginIdentifiers)
2. Follow SWR hooks testing pattern
3. Run type-check and lint to verify
4. Run tests to ensure they pass
5. Report back with number of tests written and coverage areas

DO NOT commit changes or update test-coverage.md.`,
});

Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Test mcp action',
  prompt: `Write comprehensive tests for src/store/discover/slices/mcp/action.ts following @.cursor/rules/testing-guide/zustand-store-action-test.mdc.

Requirements:
1. Write tests covering all actions (useFetchMcpDetail, useFetchMcpList, useMcpCategories)
2. Follow SWR hooks testing pattern
3. Run type-check and lint to verify
4. Run tests to ensure they pass
5. Report back with number of tests written and coverage areas

DO NOT commit changes or update test-coverage.md.`,
});

// ... similar for assistant, model, provider ...
```

**Step 2: Wait for All Subagents to Complete**

Each subagent will:

- Write tests
- Run type-check and lint
- Verify tests pass
- Report results

**Step 3: Review Results**

After all subagents complete:

- Review each subagent's report
- Check for any issues or failures
- Verify all tests are written

**Step 4: Final Verification**

```bash
# Run type-check on entire project
bun run type-check

# Run lint on all new test files
bunx eslint src/store/discover/ --fix

# Run all new tests together
bunx vitest run 'src/store/discover/**/*.test.ts'

# Run coverage
bunx vitest run --coverage 'src/store'
```

**Step 5: Update Documentation**

```bash
# Update test-coverage.md with:
# - New overall coverage percentage
# - Number of new tests
# - List of newly tested action files
# - Session summary
```

**Step 6: Create Single Commit**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✅ test(store): add comprehensive tests for discover store

- Add tests for plugin, mcp, assistant, model, provider slices
- Coverage: X% → Y% (+Z tests, 5 new test files)
- All tests pass type-check and lint
