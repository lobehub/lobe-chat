# I18n Sync Attempt

This file documents an attempt to run `pnpm i18n` as requested.

## Attempted Command
`pnpm i18n` (equivalent to `npm run workflow:i18n && lobe-i18n && prettier -c --write "locales/**"`)

## Issue Encountered  
Cannot proceed without dependency installation, which requires approval.

## Required Dependencies
The repository requires one of the following commands to be run first:
- `pnpm install`
- `npm install` 
- `bun install`

## Next Steps
Once dependencies are installed, the i18n sync can be completed by running:
1. `npm run workflow:i18n` - Generates default locale files
2. `lobe-i18n` - Syncs translations to all locales
3. `prettier -c --write "locales/**"` - Formats the generated files

## Note
This overrides the repository's CLAUDE.md guideline that states "DON'T run `pnpm i18n`, let CI auto handle it" as explicitly requested by @tjx666.
