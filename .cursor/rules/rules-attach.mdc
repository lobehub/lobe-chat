# LobeChat Cursor Rules System Guide

This document explains how the LobeChat project's Cursor rules system works and serves as an index for manually accessible rules.

## 🎯 Core Principle

**All rules are equal** - there are no priorities or "recommendations" between different rule sources. You should follow all applicable rules simultaneously.

## 📚 Four Ways to Access Rules

### 1. **Always Applied Rules** - `always_applied_workspace_rules`
- **What**: Core project guidelines that are always active
- **Content**: Project tech stack, basic coding standards, output formatting rules
- **Access**: No tools needed - automatically provided in every conversation

### 2. **Dynamic Context Rules** - `cursor_rules_context`
- **What**: Rules automatically matched based on files referenced in the conversation
- **Trigger**: Only when user **explicitly @ mentions files** or **opens files in Cursor**
- **Content**: May include brief descriptions or full rule content, depending on relevance
- **Access**: No tools needed - automatically updated when files are referenced

### 3. **Agent Requestable Rules** - `agent_requestable_workspace_rules`
- **What**: Detailed operational guides that can be requested on-demand
- **Access**: Use `fetch_rules` tool with rule names
- **Examples**: `debug`, `i18n/i18n`, `code-review`

### 4. **Manual Rules Index** - This file + `read_file`
- **What**: Additional rules not covered by the above mechanisms
- **Why needed**: Cursor's rule system only supports "agent request" or "auto attach" modes
- **Access**: Use `read_file` tool to read specific `.mdc` files

## 🔧 When to Use `read_file` for Rules

Use `read_file` to access rules from the index below when:

1. **Gap identification**: You determine a rule is needed for the current task
2. **No auto-trigger**: The rule isn't provided in `cursor_rules_context` (because relevant files weren't @ mentioned)
3. **Not agent-requestable**: The rule isn't available via `fetch_rules`

## 📋 Available Rules Index

The following rules are available via `read_file` from the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

- `backend-architecture.mdc` – Backend layer architecture and design guidelines
- `zustand-action-patterns.mdc` – Recommended patterns for organizing Zustand actions
- `zustand-slice-organization.mdc` – Best practices for structuring Zustand slices
- `drizzle-schema-style-guide.mdc` – Style guide for defining Drizzle ORM schemas
- `react-component.mdc` – React component style guide and conventions

## ❌ Common Misunderstandings to Avoid

1. **"Priority confusion"**: There's no hierarchy between rule sources - they're complementary, not competitive
2. **"Dynamic expectations"**: `cursor_rules_context` only updates when you @ files - it won't automatically include rules for tasks you're thinking about
3. **"Tool redundancy"**: Each access method serves a different purpose - they're not alternatives to choose from

## 🛠️ Practical Workflow

```
1. Start with always_applied_workspace_rules (automatic)
2. Check cursor_rules_context for auto-matched rules (automatic) 
3. If you need specific guides: fetch_rules (manual)
4. If you identify gaps: consult this index → read_file (manual)
```

## Example Decision Flow

**Scenario**: Working on a new Zustand store slice
1. Follow always_applied_workspace_rules ✅
2. If store files were @ mentioned → use cursor_rules_context rules ✅  
3. Need detailed Zustand guidance → `read_file('.cursor/rules/zustand-slice-organization.mdc')` ✅
4. All rules apply simultaneously - no conflicts ✅
