## A. Forcing a fetch to FAIL (error-state testing)

### A7. ✅ WORKS — render a message-attached error card (hetero guide, AsyncError) by in-memory store dispatch

- To render an error state that lives on a **chat message** (e.g. the heterogeneous
  `overloaded` guide card), no network fault or real agent run is
  needed — inject the error straight into the chat store, **in-memory, no DB write**:
  ```js
  // agent-browser --cdp <port> eval --stdin
  var c = window.__LOBE_STORES.chat();
  var id = 'tmp_probe';
  // 1. create a temp assistant message (in the ACTIVE conversation)
  c.internal_dispatchMessage({
    id,
    type: 'createMessage',
    value: { role: 'assistant', content: 'partial work UNIQUE_MARKER', provider: 'claude-code' },
  });
  // 2. attach the error whose `body.code` drives the card
  c.internal_dispatchMessage({
    id,
    type: 'updateMessage',
    value: {
      error: {
        type: 'AgentRuntimeError',
        message: 'Overloaded',
        body: {
          agentType: 'claude-code',
          code: 'overloaded',
          message: 'Overloaded',
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  This renders the real component (real i18n) in the running app. Clean up with
  `internal_dispatchMessage({ id, type: 'deleteMessage' })`.
- **`code` must be one of four values, or you get no guide card.**
  `isHeterogeneousAgentStatusGuideError` (`src/features/Conversation/Error/heterogeneous.ts:13-31`)
  requires `agentType` ∈ {`claude-code`, `codex`} **and** `code` ∈ {`auth_required`,
  `cli_not_found`, `overloaded`, `rate_limit`}. Anything else falls through to the generic
  error path. The switch
  (`src/features/Electron/HeterogeneousAgent/StatusGuide/index.tsx:28-44`) maps AuthRequired →
  `AuthRequiredState`, RateLimit → `RateLimitState`, Overloaded → `OverloadedState`,
  **default → `CliInstallState`**. There is no `InterruptedState`, and `interrupted` is not a
  `HeterogeneousAgentSessionErrorCode` at all (it is a `completionReason` / run-`status` value
  elsewhere) — an earlier version of this note used it as the example, and it would have
  rendered nothing of the sort.
- **No persistence / no side effects**: `internal_dispatchMessage` is the optimistic
  in-memory path (same as `optimisticCreateTmpMessage`). Nothing hits the DB, and a
  reload clears it. Safe even against a **real** account's synced data — do it in an
  isolated `electron-dev.sh start <id>` instance (copied login) to be extra safe.
- **Suppress auto-actions on purpose**: the hetero auto-retry only arms when a retry scope
  resolves. `src/features/Conversation/Error/index.tsx:260-262` computes
  `retryScopeId ?? getDisplayMessageById(data.id)?.parentId`, and `useHeterogeneousAutoRetry`
  gates on `!!scopeId`. A tmp message has no `parentId`, so the scope is `undefined` → the card
  renders in its **manual** state (retry button, no countdown) and **does not auto-fire**
  (won't spawn a real CLI). (There is no `getRetryScopeId` helper — an earlier version of this
  note invented one. The mechanism is a plain `parentId` lookup, not an ancestor walk.) To
  exercise the countdown live you'd need a real user→assistant chain; otherwise cover it with
  the component RTL test.
- **Gotcha — `messagesMap` landing is unreliable to assert; the render is the truth.**
  `internal_dispatchMessage` (no explicit context) targets the active conversation and
  the message may not show up where a naive `Object.keys(messagesMap)` scan looks, yet
  it still renders. Verify by the DOM, not by the store map.
- **Gotcha — `document.body.innerText` keyword match false-positives in long chats.**
  The conversation's own text (and the right-hand diff/review panel) frequently contains
  your assert strings (e.g. `连接中断`, `重试`, `Retry`). Match on a **unique injected
  marker** instead, `scrollIntoView` its node, then **open the screenshot with Read** to
  confirm the card (Case 1 rule). Find + scroll to the node:
  ```js
  var w = document.createTreeWalker(document.body, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT, null),
    n,
    hit;
  while ((n = w.nextNode())) {
    if (n.nodeValue.indexOf('UNIQUE_MARKER') >= 0) {
      hit = n;
      break;
    }
  }
  var el = hit.parentElement;
  for (var i = 0; i < 6 && el.parentElement; i++) el = el.parentElement;
  el.scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' });
  ```

### A8. ✅ WORKS — trigger a REAL failed load-more via store action when scroll/observer won't trip

- **Situation**: verifying an infinite-scroll `loadMoreError` inline retry row. The
  `IntersectionObserver` won't fire because the seed data is a short list that fits
  the viewport without scrolling (virtua renders no scrollable overflow), so
  `scrollTop = scrollHeight` scrolls nothing and `loadMore` is never called.
- **Doesn't work**: scrolling any element to the bottom — with only 2 rows there is
  no scroll container (`scrollHeight <= clientHeight`), and virtua's sentinel never
  intersects.
- **Works — two parts**:
  1. **Force pagination with tiny seed data via HMR**: lower the component's page-size
     const so a small dataset paginates. `AgentTopicManager` `PAGE_SIZE = 30` → `2`,
     then an agent with 3 topics loads page-1 = 2, `hasMore = true`.
  2. **Call the real store action directly** (bypasses the observer, but runs the real
     fetch + real `catch`): `window.__LOBE_STORES.<store>` is a bound hook — CALL it to
     get live state + actions (`.getState`/`.setState` are NOT exposed, C1).
     ```js
     // agent-browser --session <s> eval
     var c = window.__LOBE_STORES.chat();
     await c.loadMoreAgentTopicsView(); // hits the injected getTopics(current>0) throw
     // → real catch sets agentTopicsViewMap[key].loadMoreError → inline AsyncError row renders
     ```
  Pair the service injection (A4, throw only when `params.current > 0` so page-1 loads
  and page-2 fails) with a **call counter** to prove the observer gate does NOT loop:
  `(globalThis).__loadMoreCalls = (…||0)+1` inside the throw; after the failure, wait a
  few seconds and assert `window.__loadMoreCalls` stays `1` (no runaway re-trigger).
- **Caveat**: calling the action directly proves the render + the real error code path +
  no-runaway, but NOT the observer's `!loadMoreError` gate under real scroll (the gate
  lives in the component's IntersectionObserver callback). To exercise the gate live you
  need a real scrollable list — seed `> PAGE_SIZE` visible-source topics on one agent.
- **Gotcha — the manager view filters by source (`来源: 对话`) by default.** The store's default
  filter is `triggers: ['chat']` (`src/features/AgentTopicManager/store.ts:49-51`; the code calls
  it the **trigger** filter, the UI labels it 来源 /source), so topics with a non-chat trigger
  show `0` even though the agent owns them in the DB; click **清空筛选 / Clear filters** (or
  `setStatus('all')` + clear) to reveal them.

## C. Probing app / store runtime state

### C0. A picker backed by a list store may need fixture hydration after direct-route entry

- **Situation**: a modal reads candidate entities from a list store, while the test enters a
  detail route directly. The detail route can render from its own entity/config store without
  ever mounting the list fetcher, so the picker correctly renders an empty candidate list even
  though fixture rows exist in the database.
- **Doesn't work**: inserting database rows alone, or refreshing the detail store. Neither
  hydrates a separate list store that has not mounted its fetch hook.
- **Works**: first enter the canonical list/home surface and let its real fetch settle. If the
  fixture deliberately bypasses normal creation and the list API still does not expose it,
  use the existing C1b dev-only `setState` exposer to hydrate the list store with the exact
  fixture shape, then exercise the real picker component and remove the exposer patch after
  capture. Keep the report explicit that fixture hydration was test setup; validate the actual
  mutation and created entity through the database or network boundary.

### C1. `window.__LOBE_STORES.<name>` has no `.getState` — CALL it instead

- **Doesn't work**: `window.__LOBE_STORES.page.getState()`. The exposed value is neither the
  store nor the hook: `src/store/middleware/expose.ts:11` assigns
  `window.__LOBE_STORES[name] = () => store.getState()`, a plain arrow function with no
  `.getState` property.
- **Works**: call it — `window.__LOBE_STORES.page()` returns the state snapshot, actions
  included. An earlier version of this note said "state isn't readable from it", which was
  wrong and contradicted C1b.

### C1b. ✅ WORKS — expose `setState` via HMR to drive a REAL identity/scope change (login repro)

- **Situation**: verifying behavior on an identity/cache-scope change (e.g. login,
  `useCacheScope` = `${userId}:${workspaceId}`) on the ALREADY-LOADED app, without a
  real OAuth flow. Cold-boot repro is timing-flaky under machine load; the faithful,
  deterministic path is to flip `userId` on the live app.
- **Doesn't work**: `window.__LOBE_STORES.user()` returns `getState()` (actions but no
  `setState`); there is no public `setUserId` action to call.
- **Works**: patch the dev-only exposer `src/store/middleware/expose.ts` (HMR) to also
  attach `setState`, then drive the store from `eval`:
  ```ts
  // expose.ts, temporary — REMOVE after: git checkout -- src/store/middleware/expose.ts
  const handle = () => store.getState();
  (handle as any).setState = (store as any).setState;
  window.__LOBE_STORES[name] = handle as any;
  ```
  `expose()` only runs at store creation, so reload the renderer once after the edit so
  stores re-expose with the handle. Then:
  ```js
  var u = window.__LOBE_STORES.user;
  var c = u().user || {};
  u.setState({ user: Object.assign({}, c, { id: 'probe_scope_0705' }) }); // → scope flips
  ```
  In-memory only (no DB write); a reload restores the real id. Revert the file after.

### C5. ✅ WORKS — main-process `logger.info` is invisible unless `DEBUG` is set

- **Situation**: proving WHICH code path the Electron main process took (e.g. hetero
  `ClaudeAgentSdkSession` vs the CLI-spawn `AgentStreamPipeline`). Both produce identical
  user-visible output, so the verdict needs a main-process log line.
- **Doesn't work**: grepping the instance log for the `logger.info('Starting Claude Code SDK
session:')` line. In development `createLogger().info` routes to the `debug` package, which
  prints nothing unless its namespace is enabled (only `console.error` shows up unconditionally).
  Absence of the line is NOT evidence the branch didn't run.
- **Works**: `export DEBUG='controllers:*'` before `electron-dev.sh start <id>`, then
  `grep -oE "controllers:HeterogeneousAgentCtr INFO: [^']*" /tmp/lobe-electron-pool/instance-<id>.log`.
  Don't trust the hetero tracing dir for this — it is gated and the copied golden profile ships
  STALE trace sessions from months earlier that look like a fresh run.

### C6. ✅ WORKS — read a topic's metadata (workingDirectoryConfig etc.) from the chat store, and reset to a fresh topic

- **Doesn't work**: `chat().topicsMap[topicId]` / `chat().topicDataMap[topicId]` — there is
  no per-topic-id map. `topicDataMap` is keyed by **view key** (`agent_<agentId>`), and each
  value is a paginated view object (`{ items, total, hasMore, … }`), not a topic.
- **Works** (verified while E2E-testing `git worktree add` side-effect recording):
  ```js
  var c = window.__LOBE_STORES.chat();
  var view = c.topicDataMap['agent_' + agentId];
  var topic = (view.items || []).find(function (x) {
    return x.id === c.activeTopicId;
  });
  topic.metadata.workingDirectoryConfig; // ← e.g. git.activeWorktree written by recordGitCommandEffects
  ```
- **Fresh topic without touching the UI**: `await c.openNewTopicOrSaveTopic()` — with an
  active topic it saves/exits to the agent's no-topic compose state (activeTopicId → null),
  so the next send creates a new topic. Chain per-case fixtures this way instead of clicking
  "Start New Topic". The contenteditable ref changes after the switch — re-run
  `snapshot -i -C` before typing.
- Full E2E loop this enabled: E11 fixture agent (`heterogeneousProvider: { type: 'claude-code' },
executionTarget: 'local'` in `agencyConfig`) + one message per case asking CC to run a
  specific shell command → poll `chat().operations` for `running === 0` → assert the
  topic's metadata via the probe above. A real CC one-command turn completes in \~10–20s.

### C7. DB-seeded task rows need a `task_`-prefixed id or `resolve()` silently misses them

- **Situation**: seeding a `tasks` row directly in SQL for a router probe, with a
  hand-written id like `tsk_foo`, then calling a task procedure — it 404s
  ("Task not found") even though the row exists and the caller is a member.
- **Doesn't work**: any id not starting with `task_`. `TaskModel.resolve()`
  (`packages/database/src/models/task.ts:220-223`) only treats the input as a row
  id when it starts with `task_`; everything else is upper-cased and looked up as
  a workspace `identifier` (e.g. `T-1`), so `tsk_foo` becomes the identifier
  lookup `TSK_FOO` → null.
- **Works**: use the idGenerator prefix (`task_<suffix>`) for seeded ids, or pass
  the row's `identifier` (`T-<seq>`) to the procedure instead.

### C8. ✅ An agent-browser session can silently LOSE its seeded cookies — a 401, not `document.cookie`, is the signal

- **Situation**: verifying an owner-only affordance (a link the server renders only for the
  report's author). The page rendered without it, and the bundle came back `isOwner: false`
  even though the row's `userId` matched the seeded user — which reads exactly like a bug in
  the ownership check.
- **Doesn't work**: `document.cookie` as the auth probe. Better Auth's session cookie is
  **httpOnly**, so `document.cookie` is legitimately `[]` on a fully authenticated page —
  `cookieCount: 0` proves nothing either way.
- **Doesn't work**: trusting `setup-auth.sh web-seed`'s success line for the rest of the run.
  It verified the session at `/`; the session can still be empty later (this run's page had
  also drifted to `about:blank` at one point — see D14).
- **Works**: probe the SERVER, not the document — call any authed procedure from the page and
  read the status. `401` = no session reached the server; `200` = you are really signed in.
  ```js
  const r = await fetch(
    base +
      '/trpc/lambda/user.getUserState?input=' +
      encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({ json: {} })),
    { credentials: 'include' },
  );
  r.status; // 401 → re-seed; 200 → the session is live
  ```
  Recover with `agent-browser close --all` + `setup-auth.sh web-seed`, then re-open the route.
  After re-seeding, the same bundle returned `isOwner: true` with the owner-only link rendered —
  the code was correct all along.
- **Why it matters**: an auth-scoped assertion (owner-only / permission-gated UI) fails
  IDENTICALLY whether the gate is broken or the session is missing. Always establish that the
  session is live (a 200 from an authed procedure) BEFORE concluding the gate is wrong —
  otherwise you publish a false bug against your own change.

### C9. A component-scoped "consumed" ref is not a one-shot guard once the component can remount

- **Situation**: a persisted store field carries a one-shot request (`{ nonce, url }`) and the
  consuming component guards against re-consumption with a `useRef` holding the last nonce.
- **Why it silently breaks**: the ref dies with the component. Any change that starts remounting
  the consumer (e.g. giving it a `key` that now varies per topic/session) resurrects the guard as
  `undefined`, so a request that is still sitting in _persisted_ state is re-consumed on every
  remount — and, on a fresh boot, once more. The symptom looks nothing like the cause: a page the
  agent had just loaded gets navigated to a URL from days ago.
- **Works**: retire the request in the store the moment it is consumed, so the one-shot is one-shot
  across mounts and restarts. Watch the merge semantics — if the store patches with lodash `merge`,
  clearing with `undefined` is a **no-op** and the field must be set to `null`.
- **Test for it**: assert the field is `null` (not `undefined`) after the consume action; a test that
  only checks "the request was acted on" passes in both the broken and fixed versions.

### C11. Persisted SWR cache serves a STALE agent config after a direct DB write

- **Situation**: seeding `agents.agency_config` or `agents.model` directly in Postgres, then using
  the app to drive an assertion.
- **Doesn't work**: reload or `internal_refreshAgentConfig`; IndexedDB/localStorage can retain the
  previous config and make a fixture issue look like a product regression.
- **Works**: cold-load by clearing browser storage/caches, re-seed auth, reopen, and assert the
  fixture in `__LOBE_STORES.agent().agentMap[id]` before testing downstream behavior.

## D. agent-browser / CDP mechanics

- **D3. offline is `agent-browser set offline on|off`** (under `set`, with
  `viewport`/`geo`/`headers`), not a top-level `offline` command.
- **D6. The singleton hover action bar is hard to drive; its icons are
  `div[role=button]`, NOT `<button>`.** The per-message action bar
  (`SingletonMessageActionsBar`) is one portal that moves via DOM + a
  freeze/commit `MutationObserver`, so it appears only while hovering and
  re-hides on the next commit tick. Gotchas that wasted a run:
  - `host.querySelectorAll('button')` returns 0 — the ActionIcon items render as
    `<div role="button">`. Query `[role="button"]` (or the broad
    `button,[role=button],[class*=ActionIcon]`).
  - Between two evals the bar can vanish (commit tick). Do hover + inspect + act
    in as few steps as possible.
  - ✅ WORKS to open the overflow menu on a message and read its items:
    ```bash
    S="--session s9224 --cdp 9224"
    agent-browser $S hover "#<messageId>" # ChatItem root id = message id
    sleep 1.5
    # click the LAST role=button in the host = the "…" overflow trigger
    agent-browser $S eval '(function(){var h=document.querySelector("[data-singleton-message-action-bar-host]");var b=h&&h.querySelectorAll("[role=button]");if(!b||!b.length)return "no-bar";b[b.length-1].click();return "clicked";})()'
    sleep 1
    agent-browser $S screenshot /abs/menu.png
    agent-browser $S eval '(function(){var t=[];document.querySelectorAll("[role=menuitem],li").forEach(function(i){var s=(i.innerText||"").trim();if(s)t.push(s);});return JSON.stringify(Array.from(new Set(t)));})()'
    ```
    A programmatic `.click()` on the ellipsis DOES open the antd dropdown (it sets
    `data-popup-open`, which also freezes the bar so it won't vanish). The action
    labels are localized (`分享`/`多选`/`删除` = share/select/del).
- **D7. To get a _finished_ hetero (CC/Codex) turn that ENDS on a tool block**
  (last child has tools → `getGroupLatestMessageWithoutTools` returns undefined,
  the `!contentId` action-bar path): send a single long tool call (e.g.
  `用 Bash 工具运行 sleep 20`) and, the moment the group's last child is a running
  tool, call `stopGenerateMessage()` in the SAME eval to avoid the race where CC
  appends a trailing text summary (which would give it a text last-block and a
  defined contentId). Poll-then-stop-atomically:
  ```bash
  agent-browser $S eval '(function(){var c=window.__LOBE_STORES.chat();var t=c.activeTopicId;var a=c.messagesMap["main_"+c.activeAgentId+"_"+t]||[];var g=a.filter(m=>m.role==="assistantGroup").pop();var lc=g&&g.children&&g.children.at(-1);var running=Object.values(c.operations||{}).some(o=>o.status==="running");if(lc&&(lc.tools||[]).length&&running){c.stopGenerateMessage();return "STOPPED";}return "wait";})()'
  ```
- **D11. ✅ WORKS — catch a BRIEF blank/transient frame (sub-second) that screencast misses.**
  Verifying a momentary full-screen blank (e.g. a React subtree unmounting to `null` for
  \~150–350ms during a scope change): `Page.startScreencast` emits one frame when it starts and
  then only on a VISUAL CHANGE, so a _static_ blank produces no further frames — you see a time
  GAP in the manifest, not a blank image. (Measured: 3s of a static page → **1** frame, the
  initial one; 6 background flips → **6** frames. The old note said "NO frame", which misses
  the initial one and can look like the screencast never started.)
  Single timed `cdp-screenshot` also loses the race (its own \~200ms latency
  overshoots) and `captureScreenshot` can return the prior surface.
  - **Works — two complementary probes**:
    1. **DOM proof (deterministic)**: sample `document.getElementById('root').innerText.trim().length`
       at 150/350/600ms after the trigger via one `eval` returning a Promise. A full unmount
       drops it to `0`, then it recovers — unambiguous, load-independent. (Fixed vs broken:
       `6064 → 0 → 5646` vs `6089 → 6002 → 6042` never-0.)
    2. **Freeze the pixels**: to actually capture the blank image, keep the blank ON SCREEN
       longer by re-triggering every \~80ms (e.g. flip `userId` to a fresh value each tick so a
       `key={scope}` gate stays remounted), while firing raw CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` every
       80ms over the same window. Blank frames come back tiny (\~34KB jpeg) vs content (\~294KB);
       convert + Read one to confirm. (A raw-CDP forced capture DOES render a static frame; the
       trick is holding the state, not the capture.)
  - Byte-size is a reliable auto-flag for near-uniform frames (blank/loading), but two
    different near-uniform states (dark loading-screen vs blank) can both be small — always
    Read the frame to tell them apart (Case 1 rule).

### D13. `record-electron-demo.sh` IS real 30fps capture — but raw avfoundation timestamps are unusable

- **Don't assume the whole skill is 1-2 fps.** `record-gif.sh` and `record-app-screen.sh` are
  CDP-screenshot loops (capped by screenshot latency). `record-electron-demo.sh` is different:
  `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30` (see `scripts/record-electron-demo.sh:152-153`) — a
  true OS screen recording, fast enough for sub-second UI transitions.
- **Doesn't work**: a naive `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -i "1:" -t 14 out.mp4`.
  Measured on one 14s capture: **133332 frames muxed into a 0.13s file at 4.7 Gbit/s, 79 MB**.
  `-ss <n>` then fails with `Output file is empty, nothing was encoded`. Cause not established
  (avfoundation's own PTS appear near-identical); the fix below is empirical.
- **Works**: rebuild the time base — `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1` on the input plus
  `-vf fps=20` on the output. Same 14s capture → **14.00s / 136 KB**.
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -y -use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1 -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -capture_cursor 0 \
    -i "1:" -t 14 -vf "fps=20,scale=1200:-2" -c:v libx264 -crf 26 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
  ```
- **`ffprobe` may be absent even when `ffmpeg` is installed.** Validate with
  `ffmpeg -v error -i out.mp4 -f null -` (silence = decodes fine) and read `Duration` from
  `ffmpeg -i out.mp4 2>&1 | grep Duration`.
- Being an OS capture it is subject to D10 (black frames when the display sleeps): gate with
  `check-screen-recording.sh` and hold `caffeinate -dimsu` for the WHOLE run — re-check right
  before recording if the run has been long, since the display can sleep mid-session.
- **Pick evidence by what you're asserting, not by a rule.** A state transition lasting seconds
  (a loading label flipping) is fine as a 2fps CDP GIF. Reach for 30fps OS capture only when the
  asserted change is sub-second. And when the asserted quantity is a **prop, not a pixel** (e.g.
  `animated = enableStream && transitionMode === 'fadeIn' && isGenerating`, see
  `src/features/Conversation/Messages/useChatMarkdown.tsx:43`), record it with a timestamped
  debug-global (C2) in the same render: failing to film a flicker proves nothing about whether it
  flickers, whereas `0ms:true → 7386ms:false` pins the exact flip.

### D15. Host-page CDP screenshot renders the `<webview>` region BLACK intermittently — guest DOM eval is ground truth

- **Situation**: capturing evidence of an Electron in-app browser (`<webview>` in a sidebar).
  Early `Page.captureScreenshot` shots of the host page included the guest's pixels; minutes
  later the same command on the same target returned the webview region uniformly black
  (byte-identical output across retries), while the app chrome around it rendered fine.
- **Doesn't work**: concluding the embedded page went blank/failed from the host screenshot,
  or retrying the host capture. The guest was healthy the whole time: an `agent-browser`
  session following the webview target (E16) read `document.title` = the expected page and
  full body text.
- **Works**: treat the guest target as the source of truth — eval `title`/`innerText` in the
  webview target for the assertion, and capture the guest's own pixels via a session pinned
  to the `webview` target (`agent-browser screenshot` there) when the embedded page's visual
  matters. Use host-page screenshots only for the app chrome around the webview. Cause of the
  black compositing not established (OOPIF surface not composited into the host capture).

### D20. ✅ Main-process `WebContentsView` pages are their own CDP page targets — they hijack target selection, AND they are the best pool probe

- **Situation**: verifying an in-app browser whose pages are owned by the MAIN process as
  `WebContentsView`s (not renderer `<webview>` guests — that is E16/D15, a different shape).
- **Doesn't work**: assuming any tool that "just connects to the CDP port" lands on the app.
  Every live page shows up in `/json/list` as its own `type: page` target, so both
  `agent-browser` and `scripts/cdp-screenshot.sh` can silently attach to a _web page the app
  is hosting_ instead of the app itself. Measured: `cdp-screenshot.sh` reported
  `targetUrl: https://example.com/` and wrote that page's pixels while the intended evidence
  was the app window; an `agent-browser get url` on the same port hung.
- **Works — pin the target by URL prefix.** Raw CDP, pick the target whose `url` starts with
  `app://renderer`, and evaluate against that:
  ```js
  const list = await (await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:${port}/json/list`)).json();
  const target = list.find((t) => t.type === 'page' && t.url.startsWith('app://renderer'));
  new WebSocket(target.webSocketDebuggerUrl); // → Runtime.evaluate
  ```
- **Works — the same property is the cheapest page-pool probe there is.** One live page ==
  one `page` target, so `/json/list` filtered to non-`app://` URLs _is_ the pool's contents.
  Use it to assert per-session isolation (N sessions → N coexisting pages, and a page that
  should have survived an action is still listed) without adding any IPC or store probe:
  ```bash
  curl -s --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1: < cdp > /json/list \
    | python3 -c "import json,sys; print([t['url'] for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t['type']=='page'])"
  ```
- **Pixels still need an OS capture.** A `WebContentsView` does not composite into the host
  page's `Page.captureScreenshot`, so app-window evidence that must _show the embedded page_
  has to come from `capture-app-window.sh` (macOS `screencapture -l <windowid>`), which does
  not require bringing the window to the front.

## E. Env / ports

- **E1. ⚠️ This item was wrong on both counts — do not trust its reasoning.**
  It claimed `eval "$(init-dev-env.sh env)"` "can clobber `PATH`". It cannot: the `env`
  subcommand prints only the keys in `env_keys()` (`init-dev-env.sh:178-204`), and the string
  `PATH` does not appear anywhere in the script. It also told you to hardcode
  `http://localhost:20874`; `SERVER_PORT` is **randomly allocated per workspace** in
  20000-40000 (falling back to 3010) and persisted to `.records/env/agent-testing-ports.env`,
  so `20874` was one machine's old port (this workspace is on 21912) and it appears nowhere
  else in the repo. **Works**: read the port from that file, or export just the one var —
  `export APP_URL="$(init-dev-env.sh env | sed -n 's/^APP_URL=//p')"`. Whatever broke
  `awk`/`head` in the original run was never diagnosed.
- **E2. SPA port is configurable to coexist with another worktree.** Vite binds
  `SPA_PORT||9876`; Next proxies `VITE_DEV_PORT||9876`. Pass `SPA_PORT=9877` to
  `init-dev-env.sh dev` (it exports `VITE_DEV_PORT=$SPA_PORT`) so both agree and
  you don't fight a worktree already on 9876.

### E3. Deep-linking to an authed SPA route — NOT reproduced; soft-nav is still the safer path

- **Original claim**: after `setup-auth.sh web-seed`, a hard `open <app>/agent/<id>/docs`
  redirects to `/signin?callbackUrl=...` while `/` stays authed.

- **Did not reproduce** against the current dev server with a seeded web session
  (`isSignedIn: true`, `userId: user_agent_testing_001`). Hard-loading `/settings/common` and
  the note's exact shape `/agent/<real-id>/docs` both landed on the route itself, with no
  `/signin` and no `callbackUrl`. Either it was fixed, or the original run's cookie state
  differed. Don't budget for the bounce; check for it.

- **Still true and still useful**: `app-probe.sh auth` "false-negatives" here because it talks
  to the **Electron CDP endpoint on 9222**, not to your web browser session — it fails with
  `All CDP discovery methods failed for 127.0.0.1:9222`. Read the auth state out of the page
  instead: `window.__LOBE_STORES.user()` → `{ isSignedIn, user.id }`.

- **Works**: hard-load `/` (authed), confirm by screenshot (not the app-probe auth
  JSON — it false-negatives here, returns `isSignedIn:false` on an authed page),
  then **client-side soft-nav** with no server round-trip:

  ```bash
  agent-browser eval "history.pushState({},'','/agent/<id>/docs'); window.dispatchEvent(new PopStateEvent('popstate')); 'nav'" --session lobehub-dev
  ```

  react-router picks up the popstate and renders the route in-context with the
  already-hydrated auth. Right-panels that render at a _layout_ level do NOT see a
  child route's `:param` via `useParams()` — read it from `location.pathname` if
  you need it.

### E4. ✅ WORKS — keep Electron pool `LOBE_IPC_ID` short

- **Situation**: manually starting an isolated Electron dev instance with a
  descriptive `LOBE_IPC_ID` such as `lobehub-desktop-dev-manual-selection-2`.
  The main process builds a Unix socket path under `$TMPDIR`, and macOS rejects
  overlong socket paths.
- **Doesn't work**: long IPC ids can crash Electron at bootstrap with
  `listen EINVAL ... <id>-electron-ipc.sock`, before any renderer/CDP evidence is
  available.
- **Works**: use the numeric `electron-dev.sh start <id>` pool path, or keep
  manual IPC ids very short, e.g. `LOBE_IPC_ID=lhmsel2`.

### E5. ✅ WORKS — no-Docker fallback stack for the isolated no-.env env

- **Situation**: `init-dev-env.sh setup-db` needs Docker (paradedb + redis images), but
  Docker Desktop's VM can wedge indefinitely (`no route to host` to 192.168.65.x, empty
  vm/console.log). Verified working substitute:
  - **Postgres**: local brew Postgres 17 (pgvector available). The only paradedb-specific
    migrations are `0090_enable_pg_search` / `0093_add_bm25_indexes_with_icu` — no-op them
    in the worktree (`SELECT 1;`), everything else applies clean.
  - **Redis is a hard dependency of Better Auth sign-in** — with a dead REDIS\_URL the seed
    login 500s (`[Better Auth]: Error: Connection is closed`). `brew install redis`,
    `redis-server --port 6380 --daemonize yes`.
  - **S3**: `s3rver` (npm) on 29000 with a CORS config for the bucket. Its presigned-URL
    validation only accepts key id `S3RVER` (secret `S3RVER`) — `allowMismatchedSignatures`
    does NOT rescue an unknown access key id (403 on the browser preflight). Set the dev
    server's `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID/S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=S3RVER`, `S3_ENABLE_PATH_STYLE=1`,
    `S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://127.0.0.1:29000/<bucket>`.

### E6. code-inspector-plugin breaks Turbopack compile of Next-served authed pages

- **Situation**: the first AUTHENTICATED render of a Next-served (non-SPA) page whose client
  graph pulls the chat store dies in `next dev` (Turbopack) with Build Error `Resource path
"worker/browser/createWorker.ts" needs to be on project filesystem` (chain: layout →
  GlobalProvider/Query → trpc client → image/chat store → python-interpreter worker).
  Unauthenticated curl 302s BEFORE the client graph compiles, so it false-passes; a fresh
  no-lockfile `pnpm install` can resolve a broken plugin version.
- **Works**: `E2E=1` (or `TEST=1`) — `defineConfig`'s `isTest` skips `codeInspectorPlugin`,
  the only thing it gates. Webpack mode (`next dev --webpack`) is NOT a viable fallback
  (react version mismatch when two next versions are hoisted; `zlib-sync` unresolved for
  discord.js).

### E8. ✅ WORKS — a git-worktree checkout needs its OWN `pnpm install`, not a symlinked `node_modules`

- **Situation**: verifying a UI change from a `git worktree` (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/<name>`), which
  starts with no `node_modules`.
- **Doesn't work**: symlinking the main checkout's `node_modules` (root and/or `apps/desktop`) into the
  worktree. The workspace links inside it point `@lobechat/*` at the MAIN checkout's `packages/`, which
  sits on a different branch — the Electron main build then dies with
  `[MISSING_EXPORT] "X" is not exported by "../../packages/<pkg>/src/..."`. Renderer source resolves from
  the worktree while packages resolve from the main repo, so the two disagree.
- **Works**: run `pnpm install` at the worktree root AND `cd apps/desktop && pnpm install` (standalone,
  not in the workspace). \~5 min total, mostly hardlinked from the store.
- **Also**: a Vite dev server left over from an earlier failed `electron-dev.sh start <id>` is REUSED by
  the retry (`CDP already reachable … Skipping start`) and can keep serving pre-edit module text. If the
  DOM shows markup that contradicts the source, curl the dev server for the file and grep for a token you
  just added (`curl -s 127.0.0.1:<vitePort>/src/path/File.tsx | grep -c myNewSymbol`) before blaming the
  code. `electron-dev.sh stop <id>` then start again to get a clean server.

### E8b. The standalone `apps/desktop` install BREAKS the root workspace's type resolution — re-run the root install after it

- **Situation**: a worktree set up per E8 (`pnpm install` at the root, then
  `cd apps/desktop && pnpm install`). Everything runs — Electron boots, the renderer serves live
  code — but a full `bun run type-check` that passed BEFORE the desktop install now fails with
  dozens of errors that have nothing to do with the change under test:
  `Module '"@lobechat/types"' has no exported member 'MetaData' | 'HotkeyId' | …` plus
  `Type 'UserHotkeyConfig' is missing the following properties from type 'UserHotkeyConfig'` —
  the same name on both sides, i.e. **two copies of `@lobechat/types` in one program**.
- **Doesn't work**: chasing it as a code defect, or checking the symlink
  (`node_modules/@lobechat/types → ../../packages/types` looks correct) and `packages/types/node_modules`
  (its deps are all present). Both look fine while the program still sees two instances.
- **Cause**: `apps/desktop` is NOT in the root pnpm workspace (see E8). Its standalone install
  re-resolves the `packages/*` links from its own lockfile and rewrites shared package deps under
  `packages/*/node_modules`, leaving the root workspace pointing at a second instance.
- **Works**: run `pnpm install` at the worktree root ONE MORE TIME, after the desktop install
  (\~1.5 min, mostly cached). Type-check goes back to 0 errors and Electron keeps working.
  So the safe order is: root install → desktop install → root install again. And never publish a
  "type-check failed" verdict from a worktree until you've re-run the root install — the failure is
  environmental, and the error text (a type "missing properties from" itself) is the tell.

### E9. Electron dev's FIRST cold boot sits on the splash with an empty `#root` for 1–3 minutes

- **Situation**: after `electron-dev.sh start <id>`, `app-probe.sh auth` returns `isSignedIn:false`,
  `#root` has providers but `innerText.length === 0`, and the screenshot is just the LobeHub splash. The
  main log shows `Proactive token refresh failed` / `invalid_grant`.
- **Doesn't work**: concluding the copied login state expired. That refresh error is a red herring — the
  app recovers, and `RENDERER_WAIT_S` (60s) can expire while Vite is still on
  `[optimizer] bundling dependencies`, which ends in `optimized dependencies changed. reloading`.
- **Works**: poll until the DOM actually has content instead of sleeping a fixed amount:
  ```bash
  until [ "$(agent-browser --session s \
    '(function(){return String(document.getElementById("root").innerText.trim().length>50)})()' < port > --cdp < port > eval \
    | tr -d '"')" = "true" ]; do sleep 5; done
  ```
  Also note `zsh does NOT word-split unquoted vars` — `S="--session x --cdp 9226"; agent-browser $S eval`
  fails with `Unknown command`. Inline the flags or use an array.

### E10. ✅ WORKS — stop the main process from yanking the renderer back to its last tab

- **Situation**: driving the SPA to a specific route for a screenshot. `history.pushState` + `popstate`
  lands correctly, then \~15–20s later `location.pathname` snaps back to whatever tab the main process
  has stored (e.g. `/devtools/claude-code`). A hard `location.href` nav is reverted the same way.
- **Cause**: the main process broadcasts `navigate`, and `src/features/DesktopNavigationBridge` obeys it.
- **Works**: HMR-neutralize the bridge for the run, then revert:
  ```tsx
  // src/features/DesktopNavigationBridge/index.tsx — [AGENT-TEST] REMOVE
  useWatchBroadcast('navigate', () => {
    void handleNavigate;
  });
  ```
  `git checkout -- src/features/DesktopNavigationBridge/index.tsx` afterwards; `grep -rn AGENT-TEST src/`
  must come back empty.

### E11. ✅ WORKS — drive the working-directory / git-status ControlBar without the native dir picker

- The picker opens a native dialog, but the same write path is reachable from the store. With no active
  topic, `commit()` persists to `agencyConfig.workingDirByDevice[deviceId]`:
  ```js
  const a = window.__LOBE_STORES.agent(),
    d = window.__LOBE_STORES.device();
  const did = window.__LOBE_STORES.electron().gatewayDeviceInfo.deviceId;
  const entry = { path: '/abs/repo', repoType: 'git' };
  await a.updateAgentConfigById(agentId, {
    agencyConfig: { workingDirByDevice: { [did]: entry } },
  });
  await d.updateDeviceCwd(did, entry, { setDefault: false }); // so the entry exists → sourcePath resolves
  ```
  Create a throwaway agent with `agent().createAgent({ title })` and delete it afterwards with
  `session().removeSession(agentId)` (there is no `deleteAgent` on the agent store) plus
  `device().removeDeviceWorkingDir(did, path)` — otherwise the fixture cwd lingers in the real account.
- **Identify icons precisely**: lucide renders `svg.lucide.lucide-git-fork`. Several git icons live in the
  same bar (the dir picker's `DirIcon` is `git-branch`, the review toggle is `git-compare`), so scope the
  assertion to the trigger: `document.querySelector('[role=button][aria-label="Worktrees"]') svg`, and
  still open the PNG to confirm (Case 1).

### E14. ✅ WORKS — Electron pool instance boots BLANK because the copied golden login is dead

- **Situation**: `electron-dev.sh start <id>` seeds userData from the golden dev profile,
  but the app renders an empty `#root` (innerText length 0, only the LobeHub watermark) and
  `app-probe.sh auth` returns `isSignedIn:false`. The instance log shows
  `Refresh response missing access_token or refresh_token { error: 'invalid_grant' }`.
- **Cause (measured, not guessed)**: OIDC refresh tokens are single-use. Every prior
  `start <id>` copied the same golden profile and consumed/rotated its refresh token, so the
  copy's token is already dead. A blank shell here is an AUTH failure, not a render bug —
  read the instance log before chasing the SPA.
- **Doesn't work**: pointing `LOBE_GOLDEN_PROFILE` at the packaged app's profile
  (`~/Library/Application Support/LobeHub`) — the pool instance's startup refresh will rotate
  that token too and log the user out of their real desktop app.
- **Works — inject a valid credential the app already owns, no new OAuth grant**:
  the prod lambda accepts any of the user's valid OIDC access tokens via the `Oidc-Auth`
  header, and the CLI keeps one in `~/.lobehub`. Extract it with the CLI's own
  `getValidToken()` (it auto-refreshes), then override the single main-process accessor:
  ```ts
  // apps/desktop/src/main/controllers/RemoteServerConfigCtr.ts — [AGENT-TEST] REMOVE
  async getAccessToken(): Promise<string | null> {
    if (process.env.LOBE_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN) return process.env.LOBE_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN;
    ...
  ```
  `export LOBE_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=...` before `electron-dev.sh start <id>` (the script forwards
  the shell env). This authenticates BOTH the renderer (BackendProxyProtocolManager injects the
  same token) and any main-process fetch, so the whole app comes up signed in. Revert with
  `git checkout --` + `grep -rn AGENT-TEST` afterwards, and never echo the token.
- **Works — alternative, no source edit, when you can approve a browser prompt**: seed a
  PRISTINE profile so the app takes the signed-out path and renders the real login screen
  instead of hanging:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /tmp/empty-golden
  LOBE_GOLDEN_PROFILE=/tmp/empty-golden ./electron-dev.sh start <id>
  ```
  Drive onboarding (`开始` → `下一步` ×2 → `登录 LobeHub Cloud`). The device-code flow opens the
  browser and auto-approves against an existing app.lobehub.com session, giving the instance its
  OWN token — so it never rotates the one the user's resident app holds.
- **Why the blank shell has no login button**: the failed refresh leaves `isUserStateInit:false`
  (with `isLoaded:true, user:null`), and the desktop first-frame gate waits on it forever. Every
  route — `/`, `/desktop-onboarding` — renders empty. Reloading, soft-navving, and waiting all
  fail to resolve it, so it reads exactly like a Case-1 blank page.
- **Gotcha**: a worktree installed with `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` has NO electron binary
  (`node_modules/.pnpm/electron@*/node_modules/electron/dist` missing). Fix with
  `cd apps/desktop && pnpm rebuild electron`. Also remember `apps/desktop` and `apps/cli` are
  NOT in the root pnpm workspace — install inside each.
- **Gotcha**: `electron-dev.sh restart <id>` keeps the userData dir, but a device-code session
  did NOT survive it — budget for one more login after any restart (e.g. when a main-process
  change forces one, see E9).

### E15. Main-process code changes need a restart; Vite HMR only covers the renderer

- Adapters under `packages/heterogeneous-agents` run in the **main** process
  (JSONL framing + adapter + `toStreamEvent`). Editing one and reloading the
  renderer verifies nothing — the old adapter is still running.
- Prove which code each process has before trusting a run:
  ```bash
  # renderer: vite serves working-tree src (VITE_BASE + id)
  curl -s --noproxy '*' "http://127.0.0.1:<vitePort>/src/<path>.ts" | grep -c '<marker>'
  # main: rebuilt on start into the desktop dist bundle
  grep -c '<marker>' apps/desktop/dist/main/index.js
  ```

### E16. agent-browser session silently re-targets to a newly created `<webview>` guest

- **Situation**: driving an Electron app over CDP while the app itself spawns a `<webview>`
  (in-app browser). After the guest mounts, `eval` on the SAME session suddenly returns the
  guest page's DOM (`__LOBE_STORES` undefined, app selectors empty) — looks like the app broke.
- **Doesn't work**: assuming a session stays pinned to the app target; also assuming
  `document.querySelectorAll('webview').length === 0` means "no webview" (you may be evaluating
  INSIDE the guest).
- **Works**: `curl -s localhost:<cdp>/json/list` to see targets (`page` = app, `webview` =
  guest), then use **separate session names** per target (`--session app-x` re-picks the `page`
  target; the old session keeps following the guest — handy for driving the embedded page).
  Verify with `get url` (`app://` vs the site URL) before trusting any eval result.

### E17. Dev-mode main-process `logger.warn/debug` is invisible without DEBUG env — probe with console.log

- **Situation**: adding a temporary probe log in Electron main code and watching the dev
  instance log; nothing prints, which reads as "code path never runs".
- **Doesn't work**: `createLogger(ns).warn/debug` in development — it routes to the `debug`
  package, which is silent unless `DEBUG=<ns>` was set when the process started.
- **Works**: temporary probes use `console.log('[AGENT-TEST] …')` (always reaches the instance
  log via stdout); confirm the rebuilt bundle actually contains the probe string
  (`grep "<probe>" apps/desktop/dist/main/index.js`) before interpreting silence.

### E18. Cloud-connected desktop routes even `local` agents to the SERVER runtime — force client with `disableGatewayMode`

- **Situation**: verifying a **client-only** builtin tool (`executors: ['client']`) via a real agent turn on the desktop. The agent's `executionTarget` is `local` and the tool-enable gate (`isLocalSystemEnabled` = runtime `local`) passes, so it _looks_ like it will run client-side.
- **Doesn't work**: sending the message as-is. On a cloud-connected desktop, gateway mode is on by default, so the run dispatches to `execServerAgentRuntime` (server/queue path) even for a `local` agent. The client-only tool isn't executable there — the model flails and returns a non-answer (e.g. "browser closed") with no real tool effect. Confirm the path by reading the running op's `type` in `window.__LOBE_STORES.chat().operations` (`execServerAgentRuntime` = server; `executeToolCall` = client).
- **Works**: set the agent's `chatConfig.disableGatewayMode = true` (via `agentStore.updateAgentChatConfigById(id, { disableGatewayMode: true })`) before sending. The run then goes through `executeToolCall` (client runtime); the composer's runtime chip flips to "Local device" and the client executor runs. The gate (`isLocalSystemEnabled`) and the transport (`disableGatewayMode`) are INDEPENDENT — enabling the tool does not force client execution.

### E19. Desktop has no classic session store — reconfigure the existing agent, don't `createSession`

- **Situation**: wanting a throwaway agent for a real-turn test without polluting the user's agent.
- **Doesn't work**: `sessionStore.createSession({...})` — the desktop app doesn't use the classic session store (`sessions` is `[]`, `activeId` is `'inbox'`); agents are a server-backed model in `agentStore.agentMap` keyed by `agt_...`. The created session never becomes the active agent.
- **Works**: back up the active agent's full config (`model`, `provider`, `agencyConfig`, relevant `chatConfig`), reconfigure it in place (`updateAgentConfigById` + `updateAgentChatConfigById`), run the test, then restore every field and clear any injected key-vault entry. Also: `chat.sendMessage` requires `context: { agentId, topicId, isNew }` or it throws `Cannot destructure property 'agentId' of 'context'`. Reads right after an `updateAgent*` can be stale — re-read after \~1.5s to confirm persistence.

### E20. Killing the dev server mid-write corrupts `.next/dev` — every route 404s and `/` ↔ `/signin` ping-pong

- **Situation**: after `init-dev-env.sh clean` (or any kill) and a restart, the whole app is broken: `/` 302s to `/signin`, `/signin` 307s back to `/` (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` in the browser, `redirect count exceeded` in the dev server's own prewarm), and even API routes like `/api/auth/sign-in/email` return the app-router not-found. It looks like an auth/OIDC misconfiguration.
- **Cause**: a corrupt Turbopack build in `.next/dev` — the route manifest is gone, so every path falls through to `GlobalNotFound`, whose redirect collides with the middleware's.
- **Works**: `rm -rf .next` then restart. Diagnose it in one step: if `/signin` does not return 200, the routes are not compiled — stop debugging auth.

### E21. ✅ WORKS — a QStash-protected workflow endpoint can't be curl'd; publish through local QStash to get a signed delivery

- **Situation**: driving a cron-style workflow handler under `/api/workflows/**` (e.g. a dispatcher you want to fire on demand instead of waiting for its schedule).
- **Doesn't work**: `curl -X POST <app>/api/workflows/<...>` → `{"error":"Invalid signature"}` / HTTP 401. The `qstashAuth` middleware verifies the Upstash signature whenever `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` is set — and `init-dev-env.sh` exports it, so the local env DOES verify. (Do not "fix" this by unsetting the key: you would then be testing an unauthenticated path that production doesn't have.)
- **Works**: start local QStash (`init-dev-env.sh qstash`) and publish to the endpoint with the QStash client — QStash signs the delivery, so the handler sees exactly the production shape:
  ```ts
  // must live INSIDE the repo (a script under /tmp cannot resolve @upstash/qstash)
  import { Client } from '@upstash/qstash';
  const client = new Client({ baseUrl: process.env.QSTASH_URL!, token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN! });
  await client.publishJSON({
    body: { dryRun: false },
    url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/api/workflows/<path>`,
  });
  ```
  Run it with `eval "$(init-dev-env.sh env)" && bunx tsx ./scripts/<probe>.mts`, then read the outcome from **DB side effects**, not the HTTP body — QStash swallows the response. (A claim/lease row, a status transition, or new message rows are all observable; the handler's JSON return is not.)
- **Time-travel a schedule instead of waiting**: for a "runs at T" feature, `UPDATE ... SET metadata = jsonb_set(metadata, '{...,runAt}', '"<past ISO>"')` and then fire the dispatcher. Cheaper and more deterministic than sleeping until the real due time.

### E22. Local dev env has no `JWKS_KEY` — every hetero agent run dies at `signHeteroOperationJWT`

- **Situation**: a real Claude Code / Codex run in the local no-`.env` env fails immediately with `Failed to sign operation JWT for hetero agent` (`apps/server/src/services/aiAgent/index.ts`). Nothing in the UI explains it; the topic just fails.
- **Cause**: `signHeteroOperationJWT` → `getSigningKey()` → `getJwksKey()` needs the `JWKS_KEY` RSA JWK.
- **Fixed in the bootstrap**: `init-dev-env.sh` now generates one on first use and persists it at `.records/env/agent-testing-jwks.json`, then exports `JWKS_KEY` from `apply_env`. A server started any other way still needs it explicitly — `JWKS_KEY="$(node scripts/generate-oidc-jwk.mjs)" …` — and it must be present at dev-server **start** (read from `process.env`), so a running server has to be restarted.
- **Note the failure is downstream-honest**: with `JWKS_KEY` set, the run proceeds and then fails at the hetero _sandbox_ (`Hetero sandbox spawn failed / unauthorized`) unless the agent has a real Claude Code token. Those are two different walls — don't read the second as the first.
- **Same wall, other feature**: any async-task dispatch needs it too. Image generation (`lambda/image.createImage` → `createAsyncCaller`) records the task as `error` with `start async task error: JWKS_KEY environment variable is not set`, which surfaces in the UI only as a generic 「暂时无法生成图片，请重试」 — read `async_tasks.error` rather than the toast.

### E23b. Local image generation needs three env pieces, and each fails as the same generic toast

- **Situation**: driving a real image generation from the app (avatar / artwork studio, `lambda/image.createImage`) against the local no-`.env` backend. The UI only ever says 「暂时无法生成图片，请重试」.
- **Read the cause from `async_tasks.error`, not the toast**: `docker exec <pg> psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "select status, error from async_tasks order by created_at desc limit 3;"`.
- **Three separate walls, in the order you hit them**:
  1. `start async task error: JWKS_KEY environment variable is not set` → see E22. The bootstrap now exports a persisted `JWKS_KEY`; you only hit this on a server started outside `init-dev-env.sh`.
  2. `InvalidProviderAPIKey` → the seeded user's stored `ai_providers.key_vaults` may hold a key encrypted with a different `KEY_VAULTS_SECRET`. Clear it (`update ai_providers set key_vaults = null where id = '<provider>'`) so the server env key is used; provide `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` plus, for a relay endpoint, `<PROVIDER>_PROXY_URL` (`apps/server/src/modules/ModelRuntime/index.ts` reads `process.env[`${UPPER}\_PROXY\_URL`]`).
  3. `SSRF blocked: ... is not allowed. Because, It is private IP address.` → any reference image living in the local s3rver is fetched **server-side**. The bootstrap now exports `SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS=1`; set it yourself on a server started another way.
- **Then note which model the product actually picked** before attributing quality or format to a model: read the product's own selector rather than assuming (`selectAgentArtworkModel(enabledImageModelList(...))` over CDP). Disabling a provider row is enough to change the pick.
- **Style presets that attach reference images can still fail after all three**: local presigned URLs may return an S3 XML error body, which reaches the model as `Unsupported MIME type: application/xml`. Pick a preset with no reference images to test generation itself.

### E23c. A green desktop surface can be talking to another worktree's dev server

- **Situation**: verifying a schema-backed field from the Electron app. Writes landed, but reads came back without the new column, and the app looked healthy throughout.
- **Cause**: the desktop client proxies to whatever `dataSyncConfig.remoteServerUrl` says (E-note above). Any worktree can occupy that port — here the port was taken by a dev server started from the _main_ repo, whose branch has no such column. `init-dev-env.sh dev-next` then dies with `EADDRINUSE` in a log you are not watching, and the app keeps serving the other branch's code.
- **Works**: confirm the owner before trusting a read — `lsof -p "$(lsof -ti tcp:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN | head -1)" | grep cwd` must print the worktree under test. Do not kill a server you did not start; run yours on a free port (and repoint the app) or wait for the port. To separate a server-code problem from a client one, exercise the service directly with `bun` against the same `DATABASE_URL` — it uses the worktree's own schema.

### E25. Electron `will-attach-webview` params carry NO custom attributes — identity via data-\* never arrives

- **Situation**: a main-process controller needs to know WHICH renderer feature a mounting
  `<webview>` belongs to (e.g. a per-conversation session id), and the renderer put it in a
  custom `data-*` attribute on the element.
- **Doesn't work**: reading `params['data-…']` in `will-attach-webview`. Measured live: params
  only contains the standard set (`instanceId, partition, src, httpreferrer, useragent,
nodeintegration, plugins, disablewebsecurity, allowpopups, preload, …`). The handler silently
  no-ops and — trap — a unit test that mocks params WITH the custom key passes green.
- **Works**: two-channel design. (1) Recognition/hardening keyed off the **`partition`
  attribute** set by the renderer (it IS forwarded); (2) identity bound after mount via an
  explicit IPC — renderer listens for the webview's `dom-ready`, calls
  `attach({ sessionId, webContentsId: el.getWebContentsId() })`, main process
  `webContents.fromId()` + validates the guest's session belongs to the expected partition.

### E26. ✅ Next dev does NOT hot-reload `apps/server/**` — you are testing STALE compiled server code

- **Situation**: verifying a working-tree change inside `apps/server/src/**` (an agent-runtime
  service, a tool executor, a router) against a `bun run dev` server that was started before the
  edit. The app behaves normally, the feature simply does nothing.
- **Doesn't work**: assuming HMR covers it because `@/server/*` maps to `apps/server/src/*` in
  `tsconfig.json` (source, no `dist`), so it "should" recompile. It does not, at least for large
  service files. Measured: a `console.error` added at the top of a code path that demonstrably ran
  (child ops were created, the DB rows appeared) printed **zero** lines across four separate runs;
  after a dev-server restart, the same line printed on the first run. The whole feature under test
  had never executed once.
- **Why this is a trap and not a nuisance**: the failure mode is silent and looks exactly like a
  logic bug. You will go hunting in your own diff for a fault that is not there.
- **Works**: after ANY edit under `apps/server/**`, restart the dev server before drawing a
  conclusion. If a run "should" have hit your code and didn't, prove the server is running your
  code FIRST — drop a `console.error` on the path and restart — before debugging the code itself.

### E27. ✅ `source`-ing an unquoted JSON env var silently corrupts it (JWKS\_KEY → gateway auth\_failed)

- **Situation**: writing an env file for the local gateway loop with
  `JWKS_KEY={"keys":[{"kty":"RSA",...}]}` on one line, then `set -a; source that-file`.
- **Doesn't work**: the shell strips every double quote from an unquoted assignment, so the process
  receives `{keys:[{kty:RSA,...}]}` — invalid JSON. `getJwksKey()` (`packages/trpc/src/utils/internalJwt.ts:13-20`)
  throws on `JSON.parse`, `signUserJWT` throws, and the server hands the client an **empty** gateway
  token. The browser sends `{"token":"","type":"auth"}` and the gateway answers `auth_failed`.
- **What makes it genuinely deceptive**: `local-gateway-setup.sh` and `local-gateway-probe.mjs` read
  `JWKS_KEY` out of the file with a **regex**, not by sourcing it — so both are unaffected. The probe
  cheerfully prints `✅ auth_success` while the real browser path is broken. A green probe is NOT
  evidence the app's own token works.
- **Works**: single-quote the value in the env file (`export JWKS_KEY='{"keys":[...]}'`) and prove the
  round-trip before starting the server:
  ```bash
  (source env-file && node -e 'JSON.parse(process.env.JWKS_KEY); console.log("ok")')
  ```
  To diagnose an `auth_failed`, hook `ws.send` in the page and read the token the client actually
  sends — an empty string means the SERVER failed to sign, not that the gateway rejected a signature.

### E28. The chat input silently refuses to send when the agent's model is retired

- **Situation**: driving a real turn (store `sendMessage` or type+Enter). The call resolves, no error
  is thrown, `activeTopicId` stays `null`, and no `agent_operations` row appears. Nothing in the dev
  server log — the request is never even issued.
- **Cause**: the composer shows a small inline warning ("当前模型已下线。请选择其他模型后继续使用。")
  and disables send. A model id that was valid a while ago (e.g. `deepseek-chat`) can be retired from
  the model bank while the agent row still points at it.
- **Works**: read the actually-enabled models out of the store before configuring a fixture agent —
  `window.__LOBE_STORES.aiInfra().enabledChatModelList` → `[{id: provider, children: [{id: model}]}]` —
  and pick one from there. Also: a send that "resolves fine but creates no operation" is a UI-gate
  symptom; **screenshot the composer** instead of re-reading your store call.

### E29. Fresh-worktree `seed-user` dies on `Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'` — NODE\_PATH into .pnpm fixes it

- **Situation**: in a fresh git-worktree install, `init-dev-env.sh seed-user`
  (which runs `node <<'NODE'` from the repo root) throws MODULE\_NOT\_FOUND for
  `bcryptjs`, even though `pnpm install` succeeded.
- **Cause not fully established**: `bcryptjs` exists in `node_modules/.pnpm/`
  but is not linked at the repo-root `node_modules` top level in that install
  (`pg` was linked, `bcryptjs` wasn't), so a root-cwd stdin script can't
  resolve it.
- **Works**: prefix the call with
  `NODE_PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.pnpm/bcryptjs@<ver>/node_modules"` (check the
  exact version dir first). CJS stdin scripts honor NODE\_PATH; seeding then
  completes normally.
- Same run also (re)confirmed: `init-dev-env.sh dev` ports are DYNAMIC (e.g.
  next on 33803, vite on 32459) — never hardcode 3010; re-run
  `scripts/test-env.sh` after the server is up, it reads the ports-file. And
  the `os error 35` agent-browser daemon wedge (D8) recovers with
  `agent-browser close --all` + re-running `setup-auth.sh web-seed`.

### E30. ✅ "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" points at the WRONG file — the failure is downstream

- **Situation**: the SPA renders as a Case-1 blank page; console names a dynamic-import route module.
- **Doesn't work**: investigating only the named module. It may return 200 because the actual failure
  is in its transitive import graph; changing `?t=` values are ordinary HMR invalidation.
- **Works**: take and read a screenshot. Vite's HMR overlay contains the real transform/import error.
  After a rebase or pull, refresh dependencies and restart before treating the blank SPA as a code bug.

### E31. Web agent turns run the CLIENT runtime — no `agent_operations` row will appear

- **Situation**: driving a real web turn and polling `agent_operations` for the run.
- **Doesn't work**: waiting for a server operation when the web surface dispatched the client runtime.
- **Works**: use client observables (`messages.model`, thread ids, and chat-store operations) for web;
  use CLI/server execution and `agent_operations` for the server runtime. A change affecting both paths
  needs evidence from both paths.

---

- **E5. s3rver CORS allowed-origins must match the dev server port you actually use — a mismatch renders as "文档加载失败" in the evidence viewer while s3rver logs the GET as 200.**
  Situation: `init-dev-env.sh s3` configures the bucket's CORS from the resolved ports (persisted ports file, e.g. 26938/9876). If you then run the dev server on override ports (`SERVER_PORT=3010 SPA_PORT=9877`), the browser's cross-origin fetch of a file evidence (presigned `127.0.0.1:29000` URL) is CORS-blocked; `useTextFileLoader` shows the failed state even though `curl` and the s3rver log both say 200.
  Doesn't work: retrying in the same page after fixing CORS — SWR caches the rejected fetch for the same presigned URL; the drawer stays on the error/loading state.
  Works: restart s3 with the same overrides (`SERVER_PORT=3010 SPA_PORT=9877 init-dev-env.sh s3` — it logs `replaced cors config for bucket`), then do a full page reload before reopening the evidence drawer.

- **E6. The persisted ports file may belong to ANOTHER worktree's live dev server.**
  Situation: `.records/env/agent-testing-ports.env` said 26938 and a server answered there — but it was `.claude/worktrees/<other>/`'s instance serving that worktree's code (check `ps` for the listener's `next dev` path). Testing main-repo changes against it silently tests the wrong code, and `init-dev-env.sh dev` reusing the file dies with EADDRINUSE.
  Works: trace the listener's cwd first (`lsof -nP -iTCP:<port>`, then `ps -o command -p <pid>`); if it is another worktree's, leave it alone and start your own instance with `SERVER_PORT`/`SPA_PORT` env overrides (they do not rewrite the ports file). Remember `seed-user` rewrites `agent-testing-cli.env`'s `LOBEHUB_SERVER` — restore it in teardown if another session may still source it.

- **E7. The managed local Postgres kept its container but LOST all app data between two dev-server sessions in one day (cause not established).**
  Situation: round-1 fixtures (tasks, acceptances, verify runs/evidence) were verified present via psql; after `pnpm install` (which bumped workspace deps) and a dev-server restart, the same container answered with empty `tasks`/`acceptances` tables while `verify_runs` held only the new round's row. No `setup-db`/`clean-db` ran in between.
  Works: treat local fixture data as disposable — recreate the subject task and re-ingest instead of debugging; assert presence with psql right before UI steps, not from memory of an earlier round.

## F. Fixture-seeding by raw SQL

### F1. Seeding a shared topic by raw SQL: messages MUST carry `agent_id`, or the share page renders skeletons forever

- **Situation**: fixture-seeding a `/share/t/<id>` page (topics + messages + `topic_shares`
  rows inserted directly). `share.getSharedTopic` returns fine, but the message list stays on
  skeletons; `message.getMessages` with `topicShareId` returns `[]`.
- **Cause**: the client passes `agentId` in the query context and `MessageModel.query` filters
  on it — messages inserted with `agent_id` NULL are silently excluded (no error anywhere).
- **Works**: set `agent_id` on every seeded message row (matching the topic's `agent_id`).
  Probe the endpoint directly before blaming the UI:
  `/trpc/lambda/message.getMessages?input={"json":{"topicId":..,"topicShareId":..,"agentId":..}}`.

### F2. Seeded share topics also need `topics.agent_id`, or the client never fires the message fetch

- **Situation**: same setup as F1, but the failure is one layer earlier — metadata (title)
  renders while `message.getMessages` never even appears in network requests.
- **Doesn't work**: assuming the fetch failed — it was never fired. `useFetchMessages`
  gates on `!!context.agentId && !!context.topicId`
  (`src/store/chat/slices/message/actions/query.ts:268`), and the share page passes
  `agentId: data.agentId ?? ''` — a topic seeded without `agent_id` yields `''` → SWR key
  is null → no request, silent skeleton (a Case-1 lookalike with no error anywhere).
- **Works**: seed an `agents` row and set `topics.agent_id` (and `messages.agent_id`)
  before opening the share page. Verify the fetch actually fired via
  `agent-browser network requests | grep getMessages`, not by waiting on the UI.

## Post-migration findings preserved from canary

### E32. ✅ WORKS — driving `heteroIngest`/`heteroFinish` directly needs an OIDC token, and bun's spawn-ENOENT message differs from node's

- **Situation**: E2E-testing the hetero server-ingest chain by running `lh hetero exec --topic <t> --operation-id <op>` manually (the exact command a device daemon spawns), against a local dev
  server, with the seeded CLI API key.
- **Doesn't work**: the seeded `LOBE_API_KEY`. `heteroAuthedProcedure` requires `ctx.oidcAuth`
  (`packages/trpc/src/lambda/middleware/heteroOperationAuth.ts`) — an API key never populates it, so
  `heteroFinish` 401s. Also note the local no-`.env` env has no `JWKS_KEY` (E22), so the server
  cannot even validate a JWT until restarted with one.
- **Works** — production-shape auth in four steps:
  1. `node scripts/generate-oidc-jwk.mjs > /tmp/jwks.json`
  2. restart the dev server with `JWKS_KEY="$(cat /tmp/jwks.json)"` (must be present at start)
  3. create a real `agent_operations` row with the exact operation id, user id, workspace id (if
     scoped), and `status = 'running'`; the strict callback principal validates this durable row.
  4. sign a 4h `hetero-operation` JWT with the SAME key via `signHeteroOperationJWT`
     (`packages/trpc/src/utils/internalJwt.ts`; run a small `.mts` inside the repo with `bunx tsx`):
     ```ts
     signHeteroOperationJWT({
       capabilities: ['hetero:ingest', 'hetero:finish', 'hetero:intervention:read'],
       operationId,
       userId,
       workspaceId,
     });
     ```
     The JWT's operation/user/workspace values must match the row from step 3. Then run the CLI with
     `LOBEHUB_JWT=<token> LOBEHUB_SERVER=<app-url>` — the CLI forwards it as the `Oidc-Auth` header.
     The fixture side needs `topics.metadata.runningOperation = { operationId, assistantMessageId }`
     seeded, and the operationId must embed real ids (`op_<ts>_agt_<id>_tpc_<id>_<suffix>`).
- **Bonus trap**: under bun, a spawn failure reads `ENOENT: no such file or directory,
posix_spawn '<cmd>'` — NOT node's `spawn <cmd> ENOENT`. Any stderr-text pattern keyed to the node
  format silently misses on bun; classification/assertions should key on the raw error's
  `err.code === 'ENOENT'` (runtime-agnostic) and treat text matching as fallback only.
- **Persistence shape worth knowing**: a process-level failure that produced ZERO stream events
  never creates op state, so `HeterogeneousPersistenceHandler.finish` early-returns — the message
  error is written by `CompletionLifecycle.completeOperation`'s onError branch instead
  (`body: messageError.body ?? { message }`). Assert on `messages.error`, not on which writer ran.

### E33. ✅ WORKS — keep the Electron supervisor session alive in process-reaping runners

- **Situation**: `electron-dev.sh start <id>` reports `Ready`, but CDP and the Vite port disappear
  immediately after the shell command returns. The Electron log contains no crash or product error.
- **Doesn't work**: repeatedly restarting and treating the vanished CDP endpoint as an app crash.
- **Works**: keep the launcher shell alive for the test session (for example, run `start` followed by
  a short periodic wait loop in the same PTY), drive CDP from a second shell, then stop with
  `electron-dev.sh stop <id>` and terminate the holder. Some execution harnesses reap descendants when
  the command cell closes even though the launcher normally survives an interactive terminal.

### F3. ✅ WORKS — render the `/verify-im` messenger bind SUCCESS state without a real platform token

- **Situation**: verifying the messenger verify page's success card (`SuccessCard`) for
  Telegram/Slack/Discord. A real bind needs a live bot issuing a `random_id` link token —
  unavailable in an isolated env.
- **Works**: take the page's own refresh-after-link path instead. With a signed-in user, seed
  (1) a `messenger_account_links` row for (user, platform, tenant\_id='') and (2) an enabled
  `system_bot_providers` row for the platform — `credentials` must be encrypted with
  `KeyVaultsGateKeeper.initWithEnvKey()` (same `KEY_VAULTS_SECRET` as the dev server), e.g.
  telegram `{ botToken, botUsername }`. Then open
  `/verify-im?random_id=<anything>&im_type=<platform>`: the peek-token query fails, but the
  existing-link lookup succeeds and the page falls through to the real success card
  (`shouldShowSingleAccountSuccess` — existing link + no active token → success).
- `botUsername` drives the "Open in <platform>" deep-link CTA; re-encrypt the credentials
  WITHOUT it to exercise the no-deep-link fallback. Note the platform config is cached
  in-process for 30s (`packages/app-config/src/messenger.ts` CACHE\_TTL\_MS) — wait out the TTL
  after editing the row before reloading.
- Locale for evidence shots: `window.__LOBE_STORES.global().switchLocale('zh-CN')` then reload.

### D21. ✅ WORKS — when `click @ref` reports Done but the React onClick never fires, click via `eval` `element.click()`

**Situation**: on a dense list row (acceptance check rows with hover-revealed ActionIcons and
expanded-area buttons), `agent-browser click @ref` returned `✓ Done` but no TRPC mutation fired and
no state changed — the pointer click seemingly landed on an overlaying/other element. Repeated for
both hover icons and regular buttons inside the row.

**Doesn't work**: re-snapshotting and clicking the fresh `@ref`; the command still reports success
with no effect (so the failure is silent — always verify the click by its observable side effect,
e.g. the network request or a DB row, never by the driver's `Done`).

**Works**: locate the element in-page and call the DOM `element.click()` via `eval` — React's
synthetic onClick fires reliably:

```bash
agent-browser --session "(()=>{const b=[...document.querySelectorAll('button')]
  .find(x=>x.textContent.trim()==='<label>'); b.click(); return 'clicked'})()" < s > eval
```

Scope the query to the intended row/container first (climb from a unique text node, stop before the
ancestor contains other rows' text) — a page-wide `find(...)` picks the FIRST match and can submit
an action against the wrong row. For drag interactions (annotation canvases), dispatch synthetic
`MouseEvent`s (`mousedown/mousemove/mouseup` with `bubbles:true` and computed `clientX/Y`) on the
target element.

### E34. Shell proxy env (HTTP\_PROXY=127.0.0.1:7890) inherited by the dev server breaks auth with silent 307 loops

**Situation**: `init-dev-env.sh dev` launched from a shell where a system proxy (Clash etc.) exported
`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`. The server booted fine, pages served, but `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email`
returned a bare `307 → /` with NO `set-cookie` (body = Next `__next_error__` page), the boot prewarm
logged `redirect count exceeded`, and `setup-auth.sh web-seed` failed with "sign-in succeeded but no
cookies were written" (307 matches its `^[23]` success check).

**Doesn't work**: retrying the seed, restarting the agent-browser daemon — the failure is in the
server process env, not the client.

**Works**: strip proxy vars when starting the dev server:

```bash
env -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u https_proxy -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy \
  -u NO_PROXY -u no_proxy ./.agents/acceptance/scripts/init-dev-env.sh dev
```

Symptom fingerprint: every auth POST answers 307 in \~25ms with `application-code` time present, and
the prewarm warning mentions `redirect count exceeded`.

### C12. A globally installed `lh` ingest-report can silently create an ORPHAN verify run (no acceptance attach) when the branch's CLI contract is newer

- **Situation**: publishing/ingesting a report while verifying a branch that extends the verify CLI
  (e.g. adds `--subject` / acceptance attach). The global `lh` accepted the report, returned a
  `verifyRunId`, and printed no error — but the run's `acceptance_id` was NULL, so it never appeared
  on the acceptance page, which reads as "my ingest didn't show up / the page is stale".
- **Doesn't work**: trusting a green `verifyRunId` from the global CLI as proof of attachment, or
  passing `--subject` to it (`error: unknown option '--subject'` is the tell that it predates the
  branch contract).
- **Works**: run the branch's own CLI from the worktree — `cd apps/cli && bun src/index.ts verify
ingest-report <dir> --subject topic:<id> …` — and verify attachment in the DB
  (`select acceptance_id from verify_runs where id='<runId>'`) before driving the UI against it.

### D22. ✅ WORKS — driving the manual-approval intervention chain (批准 / 提交 cards) in web chat

- **Situation**: a real agent turn under the default manual-approval mode stops at an
  intervention card (`lobe-activator → 激活工具`, `Task Tools → createTask`, …) after EVERY tool
  call. `snapshot -i` does not reliably expose the card's option rows / submit button as refs,
  and one turn can chain 4–5 sequential interventions — a fixed approve-once script stalls.
- **Doesn't work**: matching the option row by exact text `批准` (the row nests the label; the
  filtered element list often misses it), or assuming one approval finishes the turn.
- **Works**: the "approve" option is pre-selected by default, so clicking the card's **提交**
  button alone approves. Loop until quiescent: each round, find the LAST visible element whose
  text includes `提交` via `eval`, tag it `data-probe`, click through agent-browser (trusted
  input), then poll `chat().operations` for zero `running` AND no remaining 提交 button before
  declaring the turn done. Log which tool each round approved by grabbing the last visible
  `… → …` header text. One creation turn (activate + createTask + setTaskVerify + runTask)
  took 5 approvals.
- **Also measured (fixture note)**: a task's verify requirement is visible to the RUNNER agent,
  which will optimize toward the acceptance criteria (a "200 字，no code" instruction with a
  "≥1500 字 + Python code" requirement produced a 3.5k-char deliverable) — a contradictory-criteria
  fixture still fails verification, but not for the reason you scripted; assert on the verifier's
  recorded rationale, not on your intended contradiction.

### E35. A listening port is NOT the product under test — another project's dev server can own it

- **Situation**: `.env` says `PORT=<n>`, something answers on `<n>`, and a prior session recorded
  "dev server running on `<n>`" — so the run plans a mere restart.
- **Doesn't work**: trusting liveness (an HTTP response, an open socket) as identity. A sibling
  project's dev server started on the same port responds happily; every request then exercises the
  wrong codebase, and hook/DB assertions fail in ways that read as product bugs.
- **Works**: fingerprint the app before using it: `ps -o command= -p <pid>` of the listener shows the
  repo path in the `next dev`/`node` command line, and an unauthenticated `GET /` redirect is a
  cheap signature (this repo's better-auth redirects to `/signin`; a Clerk app redirects to
  `/login` with `x-clerk-*` headers). If it is the wrong app, free the port and start the right
  server — and re-verify with the same fingerprint after boot.

### C13. better-auth email-verification cannot be completed from the outside — treat real-mail paths as blocked

- **Situation**: an assertion requires a REAL email-verification event (e.g. a hook that only fires
  on better-auth verification routes), and the test inbox does not exist.
- **Doesn't work**: recovering the token from the database. The `/verify-email` link token is a
  signed JWT that is never stored; the email-otp OTP did not appear in the `verifications` table
  either (only unrelated OIDC rows), and the send endpoint returns `{"success":true}` regardless.
  Flipping `email_verified` in the DB is a fixture, not a verification — route-gated hooks
  correctly ignore it (which is itself a useful negative check).
- **Works**: mark the case `blocked` and cover the path with unit tests, or run the flow with a
  real receivable mailbox (staging/prod smoke). Use the DB flip only to unblock downstream
  fixtures, and assert it does NOT produce the event as a bonus authenticity check.

### E36. Desktop main-process `logger.info` is invisible in dev without `DEBUG`

- **Situation**: verifying desktop main-process behavior (e.g. perf probes in a manager/module) by
  reading the dev log.
- **Doesn't work**: expecting `createLogger(ns).info(...)` lines in `/tmp/electron-dev.log` from a
  plain dev start — in dev (`app.isPackaged` false) `info` only goes through the `debug` package,
  which is silent unless its namespace is enabled.
- **Works**: start the instance with the namespace enabled, e.g.
  `DEBUG="screenCapture:*" electron-dev.sh restart`, then grep the log. In packaged builds the same
  lines land in electron-log's file instead.

### E37. osascript keystrokes go to the frontmost app — never send Escape

- **Situation**: driving a desktop flow with synthetic keys (global shortcut trigger is fine — it's
  registered globally), then trying to dismiss a window with `key code 53` (Escape).
- **Doesn't work**: the Escape lands on whatever app is frontmost — typically the terminal running
  the agent session, which interprets it as an interrupt and kills the agent's own turn.
- **Works**: close app surfaces in-band instead: eval the app's own close IPC via CDP on that
  window's target (`window.electronAPI.invoke('...close')`), or click its close affordance. Reserve
  synthetic keys for globally-registered shortcuts that don't depend on focus.

### E38. Bimodal timings from a globalShortcut handler = idle-event-loop stall (and `setTimeout` probes mask it)

- **Situation**: timing a flow triggered from an Electron `globalShortcut` callback; measurements
  are wildly bimodal (sub-ms vs multi-second) and "fix" themselves when extra probes are added.
- **Doesn't work**: attributing the multi-second gap to whatever awaited call sits at that milestone
  (it may be a cached no-op), or keeping a `setTimeout(0)` diagnostic probe while re-measuring — a
  pending timer wakes the loop and hides the stall entirely.
- **Works**: bracket the suspect `await` with markers plus one `queueMicrotask` and one
  `setTimeout(0)` marker ONCE to classify the stall, then remove them and re-measure. If the
  continuation only runs when an external event arrives (a CDP poll, mouse move), the cause is the
  native-callback context not draining microtasks on an idle loop — fix by deferring the handler
  body via `setImmediate` at the registration site, then verify variance collapses.

### E39. `apps/desktop` installed with `--ignore-scripts` breaks EVERY native module, not just electron

- **Situation**: a worktree where `apps/desktop` was installed with `pnpm install --ignore-scripts`
  (e.g. to save time). Electron then crashes at boot before any window appears.
- **Doesn't work**: `pnpm rebuild electron` alone. It fixes the missing `electron/dist` but the app
  still dies in `node-mac-permissions` with `Could not locate the bindings file ... permissions.node`
  and `ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 7` — every other native addon is unbuilt too.
- **Works**: re-run a plain `pnpm install` (no `--ignore-scripts`) inside `apps/desktop`, then follow
  E8b and re-run the ROOT install afterwards. Order: root → desktop (with scripts) → root again.

### E40. `electron-dev.sh`: the saved snapshot beats `LOBE_GOLDEN_PROFILE`, and the seeded login targets LOCAL dev

- **Situation**: wanting a pristine (signed-out) instance to log into PRODUCTION with the user's real
  account, per E14's "no source edit" path.
- **Doesn't work**: setting only `LOBE_GOLDEN_PROFILE=/tmp/empty-golden`. The script seeds from the
  saved snapshot first (`LOGIN_STATE_DIR`, default `~/.lobehub/agent-testing/electron-login`) and only
  falls back to the golden profile when no snapshot exists — the log still says
  "Seeding userData from saved login state" and you get the old login back.
- **Also worth knowing**: that seeded agent-testing login is bound to a LOCAL dev server —
  `ud-<id>/lobehub-settings.json` has `dataSyncConfig.remoteServerUrl = http://localhost:3010`. With
  nothing on 3010 the app shows `Authentication failed: signature verification failed` plus
  `BackendProxy upstream fetch failed (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)`, and the renderer sits at
  `isLoaded:true, isUserStateInit:false, isSignedIn:false` — an E14 lookalike that is really a
  wrong-server problem. Read `ud-<id>/lobehub-settings.json` before blaming the token.
- **Works** (pristine + production login): point BOTH at empty dirs and keep the real snapshot safe —
  ```bash
  LOBE_GOLDEN_PROFILE=/tmp/empty-golden LOBE_LOGIN_STATE_DIR=/tmp/empty-loginstate \
    SKIP_LOGIN_SAVE=1 .agents/acceptance/scripts/electron-dev.sh start <id>
  ```
  The instance lands on `/desktop-onboarding`; drive 开始 → 下一步 ×2 → 登录 LobeHub Cloud and the
  device-code flow auto-approves against the browser's existing app.lobehub.com session. A pristine
  profile defaults to production, so `remoteServerUrl` stays unset. `SKIP_LOGIN_SAVE=1` keeps `stop`
  from overwriting the user's real snapshot.

### C14. Read a topic's hetero binding straight from the server — the store's paginated view usually lacks it

- **Situation**: needing a topic's `heteroSessionId` / `workingDirectory` to reason about whether a
  turn will `--resume`.
- **Doesn't work**: `chat().topicDataMap['agent_<agentId>'].items.find(...)` — the view is paginated,
  so any topic past the first page is simply absent (`found:false`) even while it is the ACTIVE topic.
  UI messages in `messagesMap` also carry `metadata.heteroSessionId` only on rows the current session
  produced, so an old conversation yields `{}`.
- **Works**: call the server from the page —
  `fetch('/trpc/lambda/topic.getTopicDetail?input=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({json:{id:'<topicId>'}})), {credentials:'include'})`
  and read `result.data.json.metadata`. That returns the authoritative `heteroSessionId`,
  `workingDirectory`, and `heteroSessionIdByWorkingDirectory`.
- **Why it matters**: `resolveHeteroResume` silently drops `--resume` when the bound `workingDirectory`
  differs from the device's current cwd (`cwd_changed`) or is absent (`missing_bound_cwd`). The turn
  then SUCCEEDS with a brand-new CC session and no error — context loss with no visible symptom. To
  detect it, compare the CC session id before/after a turn (or diff `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`):
  a new file per turn, each containing only its own user message, means resume never happened.

## Seeded workspace agents: RBAC roles + real API creation are both required

- **Situation:** verifying workspace UI with a hand-seeded workspace (raw SQL
  inserts into `workspaces` / `workspace_members` / `agents`).
- **Doesn't work:** topics load but `agent.getAgentConfigById` fails FORBIDDEN —
  the cloud RBAC middleware reads `rbac_user_roles → roles → role_permissions →
permissions`, which raw member rows never create. And even after RBAC, a raw
  SQL `agents` row renders "助理不可用" (missing real config).
- **Works:** ① provision RBAC with the official util —
  `seedWorkspaceRoles(db, wsId)` + `assignWorkspaceRoleToUser(...)` from
  `packages/database/src/utils/seedWorkspaceRoles.ts` (run with bun from inside
  `packages/database`); ② create agents through the real API from the authed
  page (`POST /trpc/lambda/agent.createAgent` with the `X-Workspace-Id` header,
  `visibility: 'public' | 'private'`), then repoint seeded topics' `agent_id`.

## Duplicate @lobehub/ui instances crash the conversation route in dev

- **Situation:** after a floating-range `pnpm install` (this repo has no
  lockfile), `node_modules/.pnpm` can hold two `@lobehub/ui@X` peer-hash
  instances. The workspace agent conversation route then dies in the error
  boundary with `Please wrap your app with <ConfigProvider> (or <MotionProvider>)` thrown from `TypewriterEffect` — the two instances carry
  two React contexts. The sidebar-only routes may still work, which disguises
  the cause; clearing `node_modules/.vite` does NOT fix it.
- **Doesn't work:** clearing the Vite deps cache, restarting the dev server,
  `pnpm dedupe @lobehub/ui` (peer sets differ, instances survive).
- **Works:** temporarily add `resolve: { dedupe: ['@lobehub/ui', 'antd-style',
'motion', 'react', 'react-dom'] }` to the cloud root `vite.config.ts` +
  `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`, and REVERT the config after capturing evidence
  (snapshot the file first — it may carry uncommitted edits).

### C15. Desktop dev renderer dies on canary when `apps/desktop/stubs/types` lags `packages/types`

- **Situation**: `electron-dev.sh start` reaches CDP but the SPA never becomes interactive;
  `/tmp/electron-dev.log` shows `SyntaxError: The requested module '/apps/desktop/stubs/types/src/index.ts'
does not provide an export named 'MAX_ANALYSIS_...'`.
- **Doesn't work**: waiting longer, reinstalling deps, or reloading — the stub file genuinely lacks
  exports that canary code now imports (the stub is hand-synced and drifts).
- **Works**: snapshot the stub (`cp ... /tmp/...bak`), append the missing `export const` lines copied
  from `packages/types` (grep the missing name there for the real value), reload, and RESTORE the stub
  at teardown. PR #17436 removes the stub entirely; delete this entry once it lands.

### C16. agent-browser daemon hangs against Electron CDP — fall back to raw CDP over `ws`

- **Situation**: mid-run, every `agent-browser --cdp 9222` call (eval/snapshot/fill) times out while
  `curl http://localhost:9222/json` answers instantly — the daemon connection is wedged, not the app.
- **Doesn't work**: retrying agent-browser commands; they queue behind the wedged connection.
- **Works**: a \~30-line node script (repo has `ws`) that picks a target from `/json` by URL substring
  and speaks `Runtime.evaluate` (`awaitPromise:true, returnByValue:true`) / `Page.captureScreenshot`
  directly. Key targets: the SPA renderer is `app://renderer/...`; each in-app-browser page
  (WebContentsView) is its OWN page target (match by its site URL). See
  `.records/guest-eval.mjs` / `.records/guest-shot.mjs` from the 2026-07-22 browser-panel run.
- **Evidence caveat**: a renderer-target `Page.captureScreenshot` does NOT contain WebContentsView
  content (black hole where the page is), and the guest target's screenshot contains ONLY the page.
  For a composite (panel chrome + embedded page + in-page overlays) use OS capture with the window
  bounds from System Events: `screencapture -x -R"x,y,w,h"` — works even when the window sits on a
  secondary display at negative coordinates (where `capture-app-window.sh` fails with "could not
  create image from window").

### C17. Signing Electron into the LOCAL dev server (OIDC), fully agent-driven

- **Situation**: recreated test DB (or fresh profile) → Electron signed out; the saved snapshot's
  refresh token fails `signature verification failed`; the app must log into `localhost:3010`.
- **Doesn't work**: `requestAuthorization({ storageMode: 'cloud' })` — that targets production
  app.lobehub.com. Also the plain dev server rejects `/oidc/auth` with "OIDC is not enabled".
- **Works**, end to end:
  1. Dev server needs `JWKS_KEY` (that is what flips `ENABLE_OIDC`): generate once with
     `node scripts/generate-oidc-jwk.mjs`, export, restart dev.
  2. Restart Electron with `DEBUG='controllers:AuthCtr*'` — in dev, `logger.info` only reaches the
     terminal via the `debug` namespace, and the log line `Constructed authorization URL: ...` is the
     only place to harvest the PKCE authorize URL (shell.openExternal races it into the user's
     default browser, which just bounces to signin).
  3. FIRST write the target into the app config — `remoteServerService.setRemoteServerConfig({
active: true, remoteServerUrl: 'http://localhost:<port>', storageMode: 'selfHost' })` — THEN
     trigger `requestAuthorization({ storageMode: 'selfHost', remoteServerUrl: ... })` via CDP eval.
     `requestAuthorization` success only sets `active: true`; it never writes `remoteServerUrl`, so
     without the explicit config write the BackendProxy keeps routing every renderer call to the OLD
     server (symptom: main log says "Authorization successful" + token valid, renderer stays signed
     out, and the 401/502 stack paths point at the wrong repo's `.next/dev`). Grep the authorize URL
     from `/tmp/electron-dev.log`, open it in the seeded web session, click 确认登录；the consent is
     remembered, so later rounds complete without a click. Note the 60s polling window — if the web
     session must first do a full password login, the handoff times out; warm the session before
     triggering. After config + auth, reload the renderer; `app-probe.sh auth` flips signed-in.
  4. The desktop app expects the backend at a FIXED `localhost:3010`; if `init-dev-env.sh` allocated a
     different port, pin `ALLOC_SERVER_PORT=3010` in `.records/env/agent-testing-ports.env` and restart.

### C18. React 19 UI ignores bare `el.click()` from CDP — dispatch the full pointer sequence

- **Situation**: driving LobeHub UI (ActionIcon, dropdown items) via `Runtime.evaluate`; `el.click()`
  silently does nothing (no handler fires, no error).
- **Works**: dispatch `pointerdown → mousedown → pointerup → mouseup → click` (all
  `{bubbles:true, cancelable:true, view:window}`, PointerEvent for pointer\*). This is what the
  browser-panel run used for the camera button, the "+" dropdown trigger, and its menu items.

### C19. Legacy `electron-dev.sh start` runs on the USER'S OWN dev profile — and parallel sessions fight over ports and dev servers

- **Situation**: two agent-testing sessions (different worktrees/repos) run at the same time on one
  machine; or a run mutates login state that later turns out to belong to the user.
- **What bites**:
  1. **Legacy (no-instance-id) `electron-dev.sh start` uses the default userData**
     (`~/Library/Application Support/lobehub-desktop-dev`) — the user's own dev-app profile, not an
     isolated copy. Any selfHost re-auth you drive overwrites their `dataSyncConfig` and tokens.
     Prefer the pool form (`start <id>`), which copies login state into an isolated dir; if legacy
     mode was used, tell the user their dev-app login/server config was changed.
  2. **Cross-session port fights**: each workspace allocates ports independently from the same bases
     (3010/9876/5173), so two sessions can end up killing each other's listeners — the visible
     symptom is your `bun run dev` tree dying with SIGTERM ("Polite quit request") seconds-to-minutes
     after start, repeatedly, with no error of its own. `nohup`/`disown` does not help (the killer
     targets the process, not your task tree).
- **Works**: give YOUR stack unique ports by editing `.records/env/agent-testing-ports.env`
  (`ALLOC_SERVER_PORT`, `ALLOC_SPA_PORT`) to values far from the common bases (e.g. 3111 / 25999),
  restart, and re-point the Electron app at the new server (see C17 step 3). Also check
  `lsof -iTCP:<port>` plus the listener's `ps` cwd before blaming your own code — a listener from
  ANOTHER repo checkout answering on "your" port produces confusing wrong-stack error traces.

### E41. ✅ Electron main crashes with `electron.app undefined` — the agent harness leaks `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`

- **Situation**: `electron-dev.sh start` fails repeatedly; the instance log shows
  `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setName')` at `electron.app.setName(...)`
  with a plain `Node.js v24.x` banner, and the dev watcher then tears everything down. Rebuilding
  electron / reinstalling deps does not help; the same script worked in earlier sessions.
- **Cause (measured)**: the Claude Code agent session itself runs under Electron and its shell
  snapshot exports `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. Every child inherits it, so the spawned Electron
  binary boots as PLAIN NODE — `require('electron')` returns a path string, `electron.app` is
  undefined. Whether a session carries the variable depends on how that session was started,
  which is why the symptom appears "randomly" across sessions.
- **Works**: strip it at the launch site: `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE .agents/acceptance/scripts/electron-dev.sh start <id>`.
  Check `env | grep ELECTRON` FIRST whenever an Electron dev boot dies before any window appears.
- **Also learned this run**:
  - Background holder tasks die when the agent session process cycles (context compaction spawns a
    new process and reaps the old task tree) — every "mystery SIGTERM" of Electron/dev-server today
    traced to session-lifetime, not to sibling sessions or a human. macOS has no `setsid(1)`;
    daemonize with python `os.fork()+os.setsid()` double-fork AND keep the leader alive, or accept
    the session-bound lifetime and re-start per session.
  - Running the full-stack web dev (`init-dev-env.sh dev`) and the desktop instance vite
    concurrently from ONE worktree makes both optimizers share `<root>/node_modules/.vite` —
    two cold optimizers clobber each other and dynamic imports 504 (`Outdated Optimize Dep`)
    indefinitely. Boot them sequentially (let one finish bundling before starting the other).

### Concurrent agent-browser cleanup must stay session-scoped

- **Situation:** A follow-up Web verification starts while unrelated
  `agent-browser` sessions are also running on the same machine. New sessions
  may hang if another task is concurrently restarting its browser daemon.
- **Doesn't work:** Running `agent-browser close --all` or killing every
  `agent-browser`/Chrome process. That destroys unrelated verification work and
  can race with another task recreating the daemon.
- **Works:** Close only the exact session names created by the current run,
  wait for the competing daemon restart to settle, then create one fresh,
  uniquely named session and reload the seeded auth state.

### E42. A dev server launched as a SANDBOXED background task gets SIGTERM-reaped \~1–2 min in — launch it unsandboxed

- **Situation**: starting `init-dev-env.sh dev` / bare `bun run dev` as a background task from an
  agent harness whose Bash tool sandboxes commands by default. The server boots, serves a few
  requests, then dies with exit 143; bun logs `terminated by signal SIGTERM (Polite quit request)`.
  Reproduced 3× in one run (recorded-PID path, bare unrecorded launch — both die), which
  masquerades as "another session keeps killing my server" when a parallel run is also active.
- **Doesn't work**: escaping the shared PID bookkeeping (bare `bun run dev` instead of the script)
  — the killer is not `stop-dev`; the sandbox supervisor reaps the background task's process tree
  shortly after the spawning tool call returns. Also note the kill can land mid-write and corrupt
  `.next` (E20 follows: /signin 307 ping-pong, auth POST without set-cookie).
- **Works**: launch the long-lived dev server with sandboxing disabled for that one command
  (e.g. the harness's dangerously-disable-sandbox flag). Measured: the same command that died
  at \~1–2 min three times survived 60s+ probes and the whole run once unsandboxed.

### E43. `lh agent run` against a local dev server dies with "Gateway auth failed: signature verification failed" — add `--sse`

- **Situation**: driving real agent runs from the CLI against a local dev server
  (`lh agent run -a <agentId> --device local -p '...'`) to test server-runtime features
  end-to-end. The run aborts immediately with
  `Gateway auth failed: signature verification failed` (local agent gateway JWT verify).
- **Doesn't work**: the default (non-SSE) transport — it goes through the agent gateway
  worker whose local JWKS config does not match the dev server's signing key.
- **Works**: `lh agent run -a <agentId> --device local --sse --json -p '...' [-t <topicId>]` —
  the SSE path skips the failing gateway verification and streams the full run. `--json`
  gives assertable output; reuse `-t` to keep multi-step cases in one topic.
  Root cause (local JWKS mismatch) is worth a separate investigation, not a test-run fix.
  The CLI-as-run-driver methodology this enables lives in PROJECT.md §4 CLI.

### E44. Task SPA routes can show a debug fallback before the real route is ready

- **Situation**: opening the Task UI in local SPA development can briefly show the dynamic-route
  debug fallback, while an `agent-browser` screenshot may keep an older frame even after the DOM
  has advanced to the real Task page.
- **Doesn't work**: treating `/task` as the Task list, or declaring the renderer blank solely from
  one screenshot when `innerText` and element geometry already show mounted Task content.
- **Works**: use `/tasks` for the list and `/task/<identifier>` for detail, wait for a route-specific
  heading or control, and compare DOM text plus target geometry with a raw CDP screenshot. If only
  `agent-browser` remains stale, reset that browser session and reseed its auth state before retrying.
