# capture-app-window.sh — Capture a screenshot of a specific app window
#
# Uses CGWindowList via Swift to find the window by process name, then
# screencapture -l <windowID> to capture only that window.
# Falls back to full-screen capture if the window is not found.
#
# Usage:
#   ./capture-app-window.sh <process_name> <output_path>
#
# Arguments:
#   process_name — The process/owner name as shown in Activity Monitor
#                  (e.g., "Discord", "Slack", "Telegram", "WeChat", "QQ", "Lark")
#   output_path  — Path to save the screenshot (e.g., /tmp/screenshot.png)
#
# Examples:
#   ./capture-app-window.sh "Discord" /tmp/discord.png
#   ./capture-app-window.sh "Slack" /tmp/slack.png
#   ./capture-app-window.sh "微信" /tmp/wechat.png
