# Light Review Prompt Template

One independent reviewer covers every surviving dimension. Instantiated by the main agent in light
mode; the reviewer shares no conversation context with the author.

How to instantiate:

1. `{dimensions}` → surviving dimension ids after pruning, comma-separated
2. `{dimension_files}` → those dimensions' rule-file paths, **including extension-pack counterparts
   when present**
3. `{scope_summary}` → the ≤ 200-word scope summary from step 0
4. `{changes}` → the full diff text for small diffs (wrap in a ` ```diff ` fence), or the command(s)
   to fetch it for large diffs
5. Pass the substituted text as the reviewer's entire prompt.

````text
This message is a complete reviewer assignment. You are an independent third-party code reviewer.
Do the review yourself.

- Do not invoke review-orchestration skills or start a multi-agent review pipeline.
- Do not dispatch this task to another harness or subagent.
- Do not edit, commit, or push.

Review the following git changes against these dimension(s): {dimensions}.

## Scope summary
{scope_summary}

## Changes
The block below is either full diff text or the command(s) to fetch it. Check the head:
- Starts with ```diff / `diff --git` → it is the diff, use it directly
- Shell command(s) (`git diff ...` / `gh pr diff ...` / `git -C <submodule> diff ...`) → run them all yourself and combine the outputs

After you have the diff, read whatever surrounding files you need for context.

{changes}

## Mandatory preparation

Read ONLY the `Quick checklist` section of every dimension file listed below, including nested
example subsections. Skip `How to check`, `Violations`, `Not violations`, and `Rule sources` unless
a checklist bullet is ambiguous.

{dimension_files}

Priority: repo-specific checklist rules > general experience. Use general experience only for angles the checklists don't cover.

## Calibration (hard rule)

Hold the diff to the standard this codebase already meets, not an idealized one. Before reporting a style/design-level finding, ask: is this pattern already widespread in the existing code, and does this diff make it worse? Widespread + not-worse → do not report. Dimension files may declare themselves exempt (`calibration_exempt: true`, e.g. security) — for those, report regardless of precedent.

Calibrate to lifespan as well: when the scope summary, PR/issue, or code comments declare the code short-lived (a time-boxed campaign, an experiment, a one-off script), judge it against its lifespan, not permanent-code standards. Hardcoded dates/copy/thresholds and low-extensibility designs are the intended trade-off for shipping fast — do not demand configurability, extension points, or expiry automation; "delete the code and redeploy when it expires" is a legitimate expiry mechanism. Two things stay reportable in temporary code: `calibration_exempt` dimensions (security), and damage that outlives the window (wrong billing/credit/data writes that persist after the code is removed).

Focus over completeness: findings must serve THIS change and its requirement. Do not audit unrelated legacy code, and do not propose rewrites beyond the change's scope.

For a follow-up, assess every supplied original finding and its counterevidence against the current code, and check the fixes for regressions under the same checklists. Report each original finding as resolved, still present, or unresolved with the reason. Do not drop an original finding merely because its line is absent from the fix diff, and do not stop at confirming that the requested edits landed.

## Review scope (hard rules)

- Findings must cite a rule source or code evidence.
- Finding locations must land on `+` lines of the diff by default.
- If the problem lives in code this diff did not change, do not treat it as a fix-in-this-change item. Name who introduced it (`git blame` / `git log -L` on the location) when you can. The only exception is an old bug this diff makes reachable or harmful for the first time, at P0.
- Once a finding has concrete `file:line` evidence, stop expanding.

## Labeling

Every finding needs all of:

- **Severity** — P0 (incident-level impact), P1 (must fix in this change), or P2 (real but deferrable). Never invent additional levels. State whether it blocks release.
- **Introduced or pre-existing** — see the review-scope rule above.
- **Likelihood** — high / medium / low, judged on the real production path. A `low`-likelihood, non-blocking finding is a follow-up, not a fix-now item; on a repeat review of the same change, list it in one line and move on.

## Output

Write an ordinary markdown review, not JSON and not a structured deep-review report.

- Each finding: location, severity, likelihood, introduced or pre-existing, whether it blocks release, evidence.
- If `release-risk` produced pre-deploy confirmation items (questions about production state the repo cannot answer), list them as a short checklist separate from defects.
- If you find nothing, say so in one short paragraph. No silence, no pleasantries.
