# Agent Signal Architecture

## Pipeline

Use this mental model first:

```text
producer
  -> emitAgentSignalSourceEvent(...) or enqueueAgentSignalSourceEvent(...)
    -> emitSourceEvent(...)
      -> dedupe + scope lock + source normalization
        -> runtime.emitNormalized(source)
          -> source handlers
            -> signal handlers
              -> action handlers
                -> built-in result signals
                  -> observability projection + persistence
```

For durable memory, skill, and self-review writes, the action handler can enqueue
an async `execAgent` run instead of doing the write synchronously:

```text
action.user-memory.handle | action.skill-management.handle | self-iteration source
  -> stamp AgentSignal operation marker
  -> enqueue execAgent
    -> agent.execution.completed with selfIteration finalState
      -> completion policy
        -> buildSelfIterationReceipts(...)
          -> receipt store
```

The immediate runtime chain still emits `signal.action.applied | skipped | failed`
for the enqueue result. User-visible memory and skill receipts are projected from
the completion event, not from the enqueue action.

The scheduler is queue-driven, not hard-coded for one policy:

```text
source node
  -> matching source handlers
    -> dispatch signals/actions
      -> matching signal handlers
        -> dispatch more signals/actions
          -> matching action handlers
            -> ExecutorResult
              -> signal.action.applied | signal.action.skipped | signal.action.failed
```

## Package Boundaries

### `packages/agent-signal`

Treat this as the shared semantic core.

It provides:

- base node types: source, signal, action
- builders: `createSource`, `createSignal`, `createAction`
- shared source type and payload catalog
- source-event envelopes and scope helpers
- built-in result signal types
- runtime result contracts such as `RuntimeProcessorResult` and `ExecutorResult`

Read:

- `packages/agent-signal/src/base/types.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/base/builders.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/source/sourceTypes.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/source/sourceEvent.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/source/scopeKey.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/types/events.ts`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/types/builtin.ts`

### `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal`

Treat this as the server-owned implementation layer.

It owns:

- source normalization, hydration, and renderers
- policy-specific signal and action catalogs
- middleware registration
- runtime scheduling and guard backends
- Redis-backed dedupe, waypoint, and policy state
- service entrypoints for synchronous and async execution
- receipt projection and persistence for completed self-iteration runs

### `packages/observability-otel/src/modules/agent-signal`

Treat this as shared OTEL ownership for Agent Signal metrics and tracer instances.

## Core Vocabulary

### Source

A source is the normalized external fact that started the chain.

Examples:

- `agent.user.message`
- `runtime.before_step`
- `runtime.after_step`
- `client.runtime.start`
- `bot.message.merged`

Define source payloads in:

- `packages/agent-signal/src/source/sourceTypes.ts`

Build normalized sources in:

- `packages/agent-signal/src/source/sourceEvent.ts`
- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/sources/buildSource.ts`
- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/sources/renderers/*`
- `packages/agent-signal/src/base/builders.ts`

### Signal

A signal is a semantic interpretation. Signals should be reusable and meaning-oriented.

Examples from `analyzeIntent`:

- `signal.feedback.satisfaction`
- `signal.feedback.domain.memory`
- `signal.feedback.domain.prompt`
- `signal.feedback.domain.skill`

Define server-owned signal types in:

- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/policies/types.ts`

### Action

An action is a concrete side effect the runtime should execute.

Example:

- `action.user-memory.handle`

Action handlers usually:

- check idempotency
- call tools, models, or services
- return `ExecutorResult`

### Policy

A policy is an installable bundle of handlers. It is the composition unit that turns the generic runtime into a feature.

Example:

- `createAnalyzeIntentPolicy(...)`

### Procedure

"Procedure" is not a first-class type in this runtime. Use the word to describe one end-to-end use case:

1. define ingress source
2. emit or enqueue the source
3. interpret source into signals
4. plan actions from signals
5. execute actions
6. persist trace and metrics

When a user asks for "the procedure", document the flow above and point to the exact producer, handlers, and execution entrypoint.

## Scope, Deduping, And Quiet Background Work

`scopeKey` is the serialization boundary for related work. It is used for:

- source dedupe windows
- scope locks during source generation
- runtime guard state
- waypoint persistence for queued processing

Read:

- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/sources/index.ts`
- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/runtime/context.ts`
- `apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/constants.ts`

Use `enqueueAgentSignalSourceEvent(...)` when the work should stay quiet and out-of-band. That path:

1. normalizes the source envelope
2. derives or reuses `scopeKey`
3. triggers `AgentSignalWorkflow`
4. executes later in `runAgentSignalWorkflow`

Delivery follows `AGENT_RUNTIME_MODE`: queue mode uses Upstash Workflow for
durable execution, retries, and flow control; local mode defers an in-process
run with `setTimeout`, returns a synthetic `workflowRunId`, and intentionally
does not provide persistence or retries. Local mode uses a process-scoped
source-event store and runtime guard for dedupe, scope locks, windows, and action
idempotency so it remains functional without Redis while preserving those
guarantees for the server process lifetime.

This is the preferred path when the UI request should finish immediately and the policy can run in the background.

- `apps/server/src/workflows/agentSignal/run.ts`

## Existing Example: `analyzeIntent`

Use `analyzeIntent` as the reference chain:

```text
agent.user.message
  -> feedback satisfaction source handler
    -> signal.feedback.satisfaction
      -> feedback domain signal handler
        -> signal.feedback.domain.*
          -> feedback action planner
            -> action.user-memory.handle | action.skill-management.handle
              -> signal.action.applied | skipped | failed
```

The current policy also includes optional tool-outcome projection, skill
management, deferred completion skill synthesis, nightly review, and completion
fan-out:

```text
action.user-memory.handle | action.skill-management.handle
  -> enqueue execAgent with AgentSignal marker
    -> agent.execution.completed
      -> completion policy
        -> buildSelfIterationReceipts(...)
          -> memory | skill | review receipts
```

For skill synthesis, an inbound user-message candidate can be parked during the
foreground chain and resumed after `agent.execution.completed`, where the full
trajectory and tool outcomes are available.
