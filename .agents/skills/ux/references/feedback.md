# Feedback — loading & system response

How the product **answers back** while and after the user acts — loading visuals and
proactive guardrails.

Part of the **ux** skill — see [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). Each checklist item is
tagged with the design value(s) it serves.

## 4.1 Loading visuals・Natural

**Never use antd `Spin`** — it doesn't match the product's loading visual. Use a project
loader:

| Need                        | Component                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default loading (in-flight) | `NeuralNetworkLoading` from `@/components/NeuralNetworkLoading` (`size` prop) |
| Inline dots                 | `DotsLoading` / `BubblesLoading` from `@/components`                          |
| Branded full-page           | `Loading` from `@/components/Loading/BrandTextLoading`                        |
| List / card placeholder     | a skeleton (e.g. `SkeletonList`)                                              |

When in doubt, reach for `NeuralNetworkLoading` — the default in-flight indicator (e.g.
modal "in progress" states). Minimise layout shift (CLS): the strongest loading state
changes as little of the final layout as possible. When a surface already knows its shape
(card, row, list item), keep the layout elements — container, border, radius, padding,
icon — and replace only the text/data with a skeleton sized like the text it stands in
for — matching both its **height** and its **typical width proportion**, so a two-line row
keeps a long title line over a shorter subtitle line rather than two equal full-width bars
(which mis-signal the shape and shift as the real, narrower text lands). A generic
full-block / full-card skeleton (or a centred spinner the real content later pushes aside)
is heavier and shifts the layout; an in-place text→skeleton swap is optimal.

> ✅ The **Fleet** sidebar's `SidebarTaskSkeleton` mirrors the real `SidebarTaskItem` row exactly
> — same 28 px square avatar, two stacked text lines sized like the title/subtitle (70 % / 45 %
> width), same padding (`RunningTaskSidebar.tsx`) — so the load→content swap is in-place with no
> relayout. ❌ A bare full-row block or a centred spinner the real rows later push aside.

An **elapsed / progress readout for a long op** (a generation clock, an upload %, "running for
2:14") has a subtler honesty trap than the skeleton: if it counts from **local component
state**, it silently **resets to 0 on remount** — the item scrolls out of a virtual feed and
back, the route is revisited, a re-render remounts the node — and the user sees a minute-long
job claim it just started. Derive the start from a **persisted timestamp keyed by the job id**
(sessionStorage / store), so the readout recovers the _true_ elapsed on remount rather than
lying; and **clear that key when the job leaves the active state** so a finished / removed job
doesn't leak a stale start onto a later one that reuses the slot.

> ✅ The create-page `ElapsedTime` reads `generation_start_time_{generationId}` from
> sessionStorage on mount (writing it once if absent), so a generation's clock survives a remount
> and shows real duration; on `!isActive` it `removeItem`s the key
> (`image/…/GenerationItem/ElapsedTime.tsx:33-49`). ❌ A `useState(0)` counter started in the
> mount effect — every remount restarts the timer at zero.

**Checklist**

- [ ] No antd `Spin`; use `NeuralNetworkLoading` / project loaders. _(Natural)_
- [ ] Skeleton reuses the loaded component's chrome — content swap, not relayout. _(Certainty・Natural)_
- [ ] Skeleton lines match the real text's **height and typical width proportion** (long title line over a shorter subtitle, not equal full-width bars). _(Certainty)_
- [ ] Known-shape surface not downgraded to a bare block / spinner. _(Natural)_
- [ ] A long-op elapsed / progress readout derives from a **persisted start timestamp keyed by job id** (survives remount, shows true duration) and clears the key when the job ends — never a local counter that resets to 0 on remount. _(Certainty・Natural)_

### Whole-surface skeletons: match the layout's structure, not just its rows

The rules above size one row against one row. A skeleton that stands in for a **whole
surface** — a route-level `Suspense` fallback, a sidebar panel, a page shell — is judged by
something else: its **structural anchors**. Header height, any fixed nav block sitting above
the scroll area, where the body starts, where the first group title lands. Get every row
right and the header wrong, and the real content still arrives \~100 px from where the
skeleton drew it — the exact relayout the skeleton existed to prevent.

**Measure the settled DOM; never derive the numbers from the source.** Reading the JSX and
adding up paddings is the fast way to be confidently wrong, because the rendered height is
decided by things the source doesn't show: a conditionally-hidden sibling, a component's own
default size, a layout primitive's padding shorthand. Three such assumptions were wrong in
one sidebar — a header read as 44 was really 36, a search box read as 32 was 36, an accordion
title read as 28 was 26.9 — and each error propagated into every anchor below it. Open the
real surface, read `getBoundingClientRect()` on each anchor, and build the skeleton from
those values. (To hold a route's pending state on screen long enough to measure, see the
acceptance skill's probe pattern for parking a lazy chunk.)

**Branch the skeleton wherever the real chrome branches.** Platform and feature conditions
that remove an element change the container's height: on macOS desktop
`ToggleLeftPanelButton` renders `null`, so the nav header's content box collapses from the
28 px icon to the 22 px breadcrumb and the header goes 44 → 36. A hard-coded height is
correct on exactly one platform. Reuse the same condition (import the flag, don't re-derive
it) so both branches stay in step.

**Many variants of one surface → a shape table, not one generic skeleton.** When a shell
renders a different panel per route, a single "8 generic rows" placeholder is wrong nearly
everywhere: some panels open with a fixed nav list, some have accordion groups, and some
have **no body at all** — for those the generic skeleton invents a list that never appears.
Model the surface as data (header variant, fixed nav rows, body gap, group title height,
rows per group) and key it by route, so adding a panel is one row in the table.

**Know which parts can be pixel-exact.** A statically enumerated menu (settings categories,
a fixed nav list) has a known row count — align it exactly. A data-driven list (topics,
documents, search results) cannot be predicted, so guarantee alignment only **up to the
first group title** and treat the rows below as a plausible fill. That boundary is where
users' eyes settle first anyway; pretending to know the row count buys nothing.

> ✅ `NavSideBarSkeleton` + `NAV_SKELETON_SHAPES` (`src/features/NavPanel/components/SideBarSkeleton.tsx`)
> — one component driven by a per-navKey shape measured against each settled sidebar; memory
> and discover render header + nav list and **no body**, matching panels that genuinely have
> none. ❌ The generic 8-row list it replaced: no header placeholder at all, so every settings
> row landed \~102 px below where the skeleton had drawn it.

**Checklist**

- [ ] A whole-surface skeleton's **structural anchors** (header height, fixed nav block, body start, first group title) match the settled surface — verified by measuring, not by reading the JSX. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] Any conditional chrome that changes height (platform flags, feature gates) is branched in the skeleton with the **same** condition, not hard-coded. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] A shell that renders per-route panels drives its skeleton from a **per-route shape**, and a panel with no body gets a skeleton with no body. _(Certainty・Natural)_
- [ ] Static menus align exactly; data-driven lists align **to the first group title** and stop claiming to know the row count. _(Certainty)_

## 4.2 Loading must be able to fail — timeout → error + retry・Certainty・Meaningful

A loading state that can only ever resolve to _success_ is a bug. Any async fetch can hang,
time out, or error, so every loading state needs a **terminal failure path**: after a
bounded wait (or on an error) the spinner / skeleton must give way to an explicit **failed**
state that says it didn't load and offers a **Reload / Retry** button. An indefinite spinner
is indistinguishable from a dead one — the user is stuck with no recourse but to reload the
whole app, and can't even tell whether anything is still happening. A failed-with-retry
state hands control back and restores certainty. Retry re-runs the _same_ fetch (SWR
`mutate` / query refetch), shows loading again while it re-runs, and stays available if it
fails again; keep any already-loaded context rather than blowing the surface away.

**But not every failure should offer Retry — gate it on whether a retry could plausibly
succeed.** A `401` (auth expired / invalid) or `403` (no permission) wall will just fail
again the same way, so a **Reload** button there is a false promise: it invites the user to
mash a control that can't work. The failed state still renders (reason + status-specific copy
— "please sign in", "you don't have access"), it just **omits Retry**; `5xx` / timeout /
network stay retryable. Derive this from the normalized error status, don't hand-code it per
surface — `normalizeAsyncError` marks `401` / `403` (and anything flagged
`meta.shouldRetry === false`) non-retryable, and `AsyncError` hides the button accordingly.

> **Decision (2026-07-02): the component-level failed state does _not_ itself redirect on
> `401`.** We assume session-expiry is caught **globally** (an app-level interceptor routes an
> expired session to sign-in), so a surface only needs the honest no-retry failure state as a
> backstop — it should not add a second redirect layer. Revisit only if a future surface turns
> up where the global redirect doesn't fire and a `401` genuinely strands the user; then wire
> per-surface handling. Don't pre-build it.

> **We under-build this today** — most surfaces only draw loading + success and let a slow
> or failed request spin forever. Treat the failure path as required, not optional: it's a
> large part of what makes the experience feel trustworthy.

A common shape of this bug: the surface gates its "ready" render on an **init flag that is
set only on a successful fetch** (`if (!isInit) return <Skeleton/>`). On error the flag
never flips, so the skeleton is **permanent** — an infinite spinner wearing a skeleton's
clothes. The error path must drive the flag / a separate `error` state, not be forgotten.
The flag is often **disguised as data-presence** — `loaded = Array.isArray(map[id])`, where
`map[id]` is written only in the SWR `onSuccess`: same success-only init flag, just spelled
as "is the data here yet". A failed fetch leaves the entry `undefined` → `loaded` stays
false → permanent skeleton. Don't read "present in a success-populated map" as "loaded";
branch the fetch's real `error`.

A subtler shape: the error state and retry action **exist in the store but are wired to
nothing**. The slice records an `errorMap`, exposes `isXError` / `currentXError` selectors,
even ships a `retryX` action — the data layer is exactly right — but **no surface consumes
any of it**: the component still branches only on the success-only loading flag, so a failed
fetch is a permanent skeleton and the retry the store built is dead code. A built-but-orphaned
error path is **indistinguishable from a missing one** at the pixel; the store having the
right shape does not discharge the obligation — a surface must actually read the error and
render the failed state. When you find an `errorMap` / `isXError` selector, **grep its
consumers** (`rg isXError`): zero call sites is the tell.

> ❌ **Agent profile** (`/agent/:aid/profile`) branches only on `isAgentConfigLoading =
!activeAgentId || !agentMap[id]` (`store/agent/selectors/selectors.ts`), the data-presence
> disguise, and renders a full-page `<Loading/>` — so a failed / 404 `getAgentConfigById` (a bad
> or deleted `:aid`) spins **forever** with no retry. The kicker: `onError` **does** populate
> `agentConfigErrorMap`, and `currentAgentConfigError` / `isAgentConfigError` **and**
> `retryFetchAgentConfig` all exist with a doc comment promising "a retry UI instead of an
> endless skeleton" — but `rg` finds **zero** consumers anywhere (`ProfileArea` in
> `routes/(main)/agent/profile/index.tsx` reads none of them). The error+retry machinery is
> fully built and reaches no pixel. ✅ Branch `isAgentConfigError` before the loading gate → a
> failed state (reason + Reload calling the existing `retryFetchAgentConfig`).

The mirror-image trap on a **compound** gate — one that holds the skeleton until a **secondary /
dependent** fetch resolves (a detail that waits on the assignee's config, a row that waits on its
owner) — is gating on that dependency being **present** in the map. When the dependency
legitimately resolves to **absent** (deleted, out-of-scope, `null` by design) it never lands in
the map, so a presence-gate **hangs forever** on a perfectly healthy state. Gate on the dependency
fetch's **in-flight** flag instead: block only while it's genuinely loading, and **release on
settled** — data _or_ resolved-`null` _or_ error alike. "Absent" is a resolved state, not a pending
one.

> ✅ **Task detail** gets the compound gate right: it blocks the skeleton on `agentConfigLoading`
> (the assignee-config fetch's **in-flight** flag), not on the assignee being present in the map, so
> a task whose assignee was deleted / moved out of scope resolves to `null` and **releases** the gate
> instead of spinning forever (`useActiveTaskDetail.ts:66-77`); the task skeleton itself is likewise
> gated on "resolving", not on `data === undefined`.

A close cousin, and the most deceptive: the error branch **exists in the very same component
and even reads the real fetch `error`** — but it's ordered **after** an `if (isLoading) return <Skeleton/>` early-return whose `isLoading` is the data-presence flag (`!map[id]`). On a
first-load failure the entry never lands, so `isLoading` stays true, the skeleton
short-circuits the function, and the error render **below it is unreachable** — it paints only
on a **revalidation** failure, when the data is already present. A resolved **not-found**
(`null`) hits the same wall: dropped in the success handler, it never populates the map either,
so a deleted / missing record shows a **permanent skeleton** instead of a 404. Ordering is the
bug: a built error branch a first-load failure can't reach is as good as an absent one. Check
`error` / not-found **before** the loading gate, or make the gate go false on **settled** (data
/ `null` / error).

> ❌ **Agent document view** (`/agent/:aid/docs/:docId`) has the error state written but
> ordering-dead: `DocumentIdMode` renders `{error && <EditorError/>}` off the real SWR `error`,
> but only after `if (isLoading) return <EditorSkeleton/>`, where `isLoading =
editorSelectors.isDocumentLoading(id) = !documents[id]` (`EditorCanvas/DocumentIdMode.tsx`,
> `store/document/slices/editor/selectors.ts`). `useFetchDocument` writes `documents[id]` only in
> its `onData`, and returns **`null` (not a throw) on not-found**, dropped by an early return
> (`store/document/slices/document/action.ts`). So a first-load 500 **and** a deleted / bad
> `docId` both leave the entry `undefined` → **permanent skeleton, no retry**; the `EditorError`
> alert can only appear when a later focus-revalidation fails over already-loaded content. ✅
> Branch `error` and resolved-`null` **before** the loading gate → a failed state (reason +
> Reload via `mutate`) and a real not-found, keeping the skeleton only for `!error && no-data-yet`.

A third shape, in a **transient / auto-dismissing** surface (an upload dock, a progress toast,
a status snackbar that clears itself after N seconds): auto-dismiss is a **success** affordance,
not a universal one. When the timer also fires on the **failed** state it clears the error — and
often the failed item itself — before the user can react, so the failure is not just un-retryable
but **invisible**. Gate auto-dismiss on success only; a failed item must **persist** (stay in the
dock / keep the toast) and carry a **Retry**. Dismissing a failure should be the user's choice,
never a countdown's.

> ❌ The **Resource** upload dock auto-dismisses after 3s whenever the status isn't `uploading`
> or `pending` — so the **`error`** state falls through too: a failed upload hides the dock and
> `removeFiles` after 3s (`ResourceManager/components/UploadDock/index.tsx`), with no error kept
> and no retry anywhere. ✅ Guard the timer on `success` only; keep failed files with a per-item
> Retry.

Another shape, on the **write** side: an action that gates forward navigation sets an
`isNavigating` / `isSubmitting` flag, `await`s a write, then advances — but with **no
`finally`**. If the write rejects, the flag never resets, so the advance control (and often
Back with it) stays `disabled` **forever**, with no error and no retry — a dead end wearing a
"busy" label, and worse when that write is the one gating the whole flow. Reset the in-progress
flag in `finally`, and on `catch` surface the error + a retry; a failed write must never
permanently disable the only way forward.

> ✅ A panel whose data request errors or exceeds its timeout shows "加载失败" with a
> **Reload** button that refetches. ❌ A `NeuralNetworkLoading` that spins indefinitely when
> the request hangs. ❌ `isInit` set only in the success handler, so a failed fetch leaves
> the skeleton up forever. ❌ The onboarding language step `await setSettings(...)` — the write
> that gates `commonStepsCompleted` — with no try/catch/finally, so a failed write leaves
> `isNavigating` true and Send + Back stay `disabled` forever, trapping the user on the step
> (`ResponseLanguageStep.tsx`); ✅ the desktop `LoginStep` idle/loading/success/error state
> machine with retry + cancel is the shape it should follow. ❌ A builtin-client consent page auto-submits a hidden form on
> mount and renders `Result status="success"` with a spinner + "redirecting…"; if that POST
> fails the user is stuck on a **permanent success-styled spinner** with no retry
> (`OAuthConsent/Consent/BuiltinConsent.tsx`) — a loading state that both can't fail and
> mislabels itself "success". _(pairs with Read §1.1 error state, §4.1 loading visuals.)_
> ❌ The **whole Eval module** wires 9 SWR fetches with an `onSuccess`-only handler and no
> `onError` (`store/eval/slices/{benchmark,dataset,run,testCase}/action.ts`); every list /
> detail ready-flag (`benchmarkListInit`, `isLoadingDatasets`, `isLoadingRuns`, …) flips only
> on success, so one root cause hangs a **permanent skeleton** on the sidebar + bench detail,
> a false-empty on the overview, and a blank on run / case / dataset detail — five surfaces,
> zero error paths.
> ❌ The **Memory** (记忆) area repeats it: every `userMemory` fetch registers an `onSuccess`
> only, no `onError` (`store/userMemory/slices/{context,activity,identity,preference,experience}/action.ts`,
> `home/action.ts`, `base/action.ts` `useFetchMemoryDetail`); each list gate `showLoading =
xSearchLoading || !xInit` flips only on success, so a failed load hangs a **permanent skeleton**
> on all five list tabs, a **false-empty** on home, and a **blank panel** on all five detail
> panels — no `*Error` field even exists to branch on. ❌ Its edit modal is the write-side twin:
> `EditorModal onOk` does `setConfirmLoading(true) → await onConfirm → setConfirmLoading(false)`
> with **no try/catch/finally** (`src/features/EditorModal/index.tsx`), so a failed save spins the
> OK button forever and the edit is lost on close. ✅ The same area's `DateRangeModal` submit is the
> model to copy: a `submitting` guard against double-submit + **try/catch/finally** (resets the flag,
> toasts on failure) + success toast then close (`memory/features/MemoryAnalysis/DateRangeModal.tsx`).
> ❌ The **Task list / kanban** repeats the read-side trap: `isTaskListInit` / `isTaskGroupListInit`
> flip true **only** in the SWR `onSuccess` (`store/task/slices/list/action.ts:146-155,110-116`) —
> no `onError`, and the hook's `error` / `isLoading` are **discarded at the call site**
> (`AgentTasksPage.tsx:63`), so a failed `taskService.list()` leaves `!isInit` → the skeleton
> (`TaskList.tsx:203`) spins forever with no retry.
> ❌ The **create / generation** surfaces (视频 / 图像) hit the data-presence-disguised variant:
> `useFetchGenerationBatches` registers **`onSuccess` only, no `onError`**
> (`store/{video,image}/slices/generationBatch/action.ts`), the "loaded" gate is
> `isCurrentGenerationTopicLoaded = Array.isArray(generationBatchesMap[topicId])`
> (`…/selectors.ts:23-27`), and the **shared** shell renders `!loaded` → `<SkeletonList/>` /
> `!hasGenerations` → `<EmptyState/>` / feed with **no error branch**
> (`routes/(main)/(create)/features/GenerationWorkspace/Content.tsx:39-45`). A failed batch
> fetch never populates the map, so the skeleton is permanent with no retry on **both surfaces
> and any future one built on the shell** (the sidebar `useFetchGenerationTopics` is the same
> success-only shape).
> ❌ The **Discover / Community** lists are the trap in its **purest** form — no init flag even
> needed. All 8 list slices register `useSWR(key, fetcher, { revalidateOnFocus: false })` with
> **no `onError`** (`store/discover/slices/*/action.ts`), every call site destructures
> `{ data, isLoading }` and **discards `error`**, then gates `if (isLoading || !data) return <Loading/>` (`community/(list)/agent/index.tsx:18,29` + 7 twins) — so `!data` **is** the
> success-only gate. Worse, the fetcher **suppresses even the fallback toast**
> (`services/discover.ts:117` `{ context: { showNotification: false } }`). A failed market
> fetch → permanent skeleton on the primary content of every Discover tab, no error, no retry,
> no toast (the `mutate` needed to retry is already returned, unused). ✅ Read `error` at the
> call site (or a shared list-shell) and render a failed state with Reload before the `!data`
> branch.
> ❌ The **chat message stream** — the product's highest-traffic surface — has the same trap:
> `useFetchMessages` registers **`onData` only, no `onError`**
> (`store/chat/slices/message/actions/query.ts:216-232`,
> `features/Conversation/store/slices/data/action.ts:211-266`); `messagesInit` flips true only
> in the success `onData` (or via `hasInitMessages = !!dbMessagesMap[key]`,
> `ConversationArea.tsx:95` → `StoreUpdater.tsx:73`), and `ChatList` **discards the SWR
> `error`** (keeps `messagesSWR` but reads only `.isValidating`, `ChatList/index.tsx:97,157`),
> rendering `!messagesInit → <SkeletonList/>` with **no error branch**
> (`ChatList/index.tsx:174`). A failed `getMessages` for a selected topic hangs a **permanent
> skeleton** on the core chat — no reason, no Reload. ✅ Branch the fetch's `error` to a failed
> state with Retry (see the topic audit).

A distinct shape lives on the **load-more / infinite-scroll** path, not the initial load. The
first page renders fine, so the surface _looks_ healthy — the trap is the **next-page** fetch:
its `catch` merely resets `isLoadingMore` to false with **no error state and no retry**, so a
failed page-N load makes the "Loading more…" row **vanish** and the list just stops,
indistinguishable from reaching the end — while `hasMore` is still `true`. Worse, when the
trigger is an `IntersectionObserver`, any scroll nudge re-fires it → the surface **silently
retries a failing endpoint** with zero user feedback. A pagination failure owes the same
terminal state as an initial one: an inline **"couldn't load more — Retry"** row at the list
tail, kept distinct from the genuine end-of-list.

> ❌ **Agent topics** (`/agent/:aid/topics`) hits both shapes. The initial fetch reads only
> `{ isLoading }` and **never `error`** (`AgentTopicManager/index.tsx:76`); the view map is
> populated only in the SWR success `onData`, so a failed load leaves it empty and the page
> renders the **first-run "no topics yet — start a chat" empty** (`EmptyState.tsx:35`) — a
> failure masquerading as onboarding, no reason, no retry (Read §1.1). And
> `loadMoreAgentTopicsView`'s `catch` only flips `isLoadingMore` back to false
> (`store/chat/slices/topic/action.ts:678-689`, same in `loadMoreTopics:765-776`) — a failed
> page-N load silently drops the "Loading more…" row (`index.tsx:251`) with `hasMore` still
> true and the observer (`index.tsx:185-193`) re-firing on scroll. ✅ Branch the initial `error`
> to a failed state with Reload; render a Retry row when a page fetch rejects.

**Checklist**

- [ ] Every loading state has a terminal failure path — on error or after a bounded timeout, not an infinite spinner. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] A **load-more / infinite-scroll** page fetch that fails shows an inline Retry at the list tail (distinct from end-of-list), never a silently vanished "loading more" row with `hasMore` still true — and doesn't let an `IntersectionObserver` re-fire into a silent retry loop. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] An init/ready flag isn't gated on success only — the error path resolves the loading state too, no permanent skeleton. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] The error state is actually **consumed by a surface**, not just modeled in the store — an `errorMap` / `isXError` selector / `retryX` action with **zero call sites** (`rg` the consumers) is a permanent skeleton wearing a built-but-orphaned error path; the store having the right shape doesn't discharge the obligation. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] A compound gate waiting on a **secondary/dependent** fetch gates on its **in-flight** flag and releases on settled (data / resolved-`null` / error), never on the dependency being **present** in a map — a legitimately absent dependency (deleted / out-of-scope) must not hang the gate. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] An error branch isn't **ordered after** a data-presence loading gate — `{error && …}` placed below `if (isLoading) return <Skeleton/>` where `isLoading = !map[id]` is **unreachable on first-load failure** (a failed / not-found fetch never populates the map, so the skeleton short-circuits; it paints only on a **revalidation** failure over already-loaded data), and a resolved-`null` not-found hangs the same permanent skeleton. Check `error` / not-found **before** the loading gate, or flip the gate on settled. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] An awaited write that gates navigation resets its in-progress flag in `finally` and offers retry on `catch` — a failed write never permanently disables the advance / Back control. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] The failed state names the failure and offers a **Reload / Retry** action. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] Retry is **gated on retryability**, not shown unconditionally — a `401` / `403` (or `meta.shouldRetry === false`) failure renders the reason but **omits Retry** (a retry there just fails again); derive it from the normalized error status, not per-surface. `401` session-expiry is assumed handled by a **global** redirect to sign-in, so a surface does not add its own redirect layer. _(Certainty・Meaningful)_
- [ ] A **deterministic-cause** failure whose fix lives elsewhere (budget / quota exceeded → top-up・upgrade; permission denied → request access; config invalid → open settings) leads with the **remedy action**, not a bare **Retry** — retrying the same run reproduces the same failure, so an unqualified Retry is a false promise. Map the known terminal error type to its action; keep Retry only as the secondary for genuinely transient causes. _(Meaningful・Certainty)_
- [ ] Retry re-runs the same fetch, shows loading while re-running, and stays available on repeat failure. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] Already-loaded context is preserved on failure — don't wipe the surface. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] In an auto-dismissing surface (upload dock / progress toast), auto-dismiss fires on **success only** — a failed item persists with a Retry, never cleared by the countdown. _(Certainty・Meaningful)_

## 4.3 Capability-gated features・Certainty・Meaningful

A feature can be fully built and still produce a broken result when the selected model —
or its still-loading config — **can't deliver the capability the feature depends on**
(e.g. an agentic run on a model without tool calling). This is usually the user's
configuration choice, not a defect; but if the product stays silent the user reads it as
broken. Owe a **proactive, non-blocking reminder** — a guardrail, not a gate: a soft
inline warning at the point of action, never a hard block or a modal that stops the user.
Stay reactive — the reminder clears the moment the user switches to a capable model
(derive from live state, not a one-shot check). Don't warn while config is still loading
(an unresolved capability looks "unsupported" — a false alarm); warn only on a _resolved_
unsupported state. Scope to the mode that needs it — one reminder per root cause — and
state both the problem and the remedy.

**Soft-inline is right only when the user can fix it _in context_.** The "never a hard block"
rule above assumes a **model / config** capability — the user switches the model dropdown and
the feature works, so blocking them would be gratuitous. A different class of gap is
**structural**: the capability is absent because of the **platform / deployment**, not a choice
the user can flip on this screen — a build served without the backend the feature needs (no
database, a client-only distribution), a plan that doesn't include the feature. Here there is
nothing to switch, so a soft inline warning over a half-working surface is _worse_ than honest:
render a **full-surface gate** that says the feature isn't available in this context **and
carries the remedy** (how to self-host / enable the backend, upgrade the plan), not a bare "not
supported". The distinction is user-fixable-here → soft inline; not-fixable-here → full gate
with a path out. Both still owe the remedy.

> ✅ The image-generation surface renders `NotSupportClient` — a full-surface explainer with
> feature cards + links to self-hosting-database docs and the hosted app — when the client build
> lacks the DB backend generation needs (`image/NotSupportClient.tsx`), instead of showing a dead
> composer. The remedy is _in the gate_. ❌ A model-capability gap hard-blocking the surface, or
> conversely a platform-absent feature faking a working UI that silently no-ops.

**Checklist**

- [ ] A **model / config** capability gap (user can switch here) shows a soft inline warning, never a hard block. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] A **platform / deployment** capability gap (not fixable on this screen) shows a full-surface gate **with the remedy** (self-host / enable / upgrade), never a soft warning over a half-working surface or a faked-working no-op. _(Certainty・Meaningful)_
- [ ] Reminder is reactive — clears when a capable model is selected. _(Natural)_
- [ ] No warning while config is still loading; only on resolved-unsupported. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] Scoped to the dependent mode; one reminder per root cause. _(Natural・Certainty)_
- [ ] Copy states the problem and the remedy. _(Meaningful)_

## 4.4 Autosave needs a persistent save-state, and one convention per surface・Certainty・Meaningful

A settings / config surface that **saves on every change** (`onValuesChange → setSettings`,
toggle → store action) has no explicit "Save" button, so the write is invisible — and an
invisible write that **fails silently is a config-loss trap**: the user flips a switch,
sees nothing, believes it took, and it didn't. Autosave therefore owes a **persistent
save-state**, not a fire-and-forget: reflect **saving → saved → failed**, and on failure
show an inline error **with retry** (and keep the user's new value, don't snap the control
back without saying why). A one-shot success toast is optional for a silent-save; a
**failure signal is mandatory** (pairs with §4.2 — the write can fail just like a read).

Just as important, a surface with many such fields must use **one save-feedback
convention**, not a different one per field/tab (consistency is semantic): if changing a
setting here confirms one way, changing a setting there must confirm the same way. A shared
form wrapper is the natural home for this — bake the save-state affordance into the wrapper
so tabs can't each re-invent (or forget) it.

**The rule is about surfacing the save-state, not about autosave specifically.** Autosave is
one convention; an **explicit per-field / per-section `Save` button** is another equally
valid one — and sometimes the better fit (a namespace/handle edit that must validate
uniqueness, a field where a mid-typing autosave would thrash). What §4.4 demands holds either
way: whichever you pick, the write must show **saving → saved → failed** (a `Save` button owes
a loading spinner + a success tick + an on-failure inline error that **keeps the edited
value**), and you must pick **one** convention for the surface, not mix autosave-here /
explicit-Save-there. Choosing explicit Save doesn't exempt you from the failure signal — it
just moves it onto the button.

> ✅ An autosave field shows a subtle "saved" tick on success and, on failure, an inline
> "保存失败" with a **Retry** that re-runs the write and keeps the edited value.
> ✅ **Community workspace settings** takes the explicit-Save route and does it right: each
> field has its own `Save` button driving a `savingField` loading state, a success toast, and
> an on-failure `message.error` (plus an inline field error for the namespace-taken case) that
> **keeps the edited value** rather than snapping it back — one convention applied across every
> field of the surface (`CommunityWorkspaceSettings.tsx:310-352`). Explicit Save, full
> save-state, no silent write — the discipline the same area's read side lacks (see Read §1.1). ❌ The
> Appearance / Advanced / hotkey-essential forms call `setSettings` from `onValuesChange`
> with **no success and no failure feedback** — a failed save is indistinguishable from a
> successful one (`settings/appearance`, `settings/advanced`). ❌ The same settings area
> confirms saves four different ways across tabs (silent / `message.success` /
> `notification.success` / toast-on-test-only) with no shared convention. ❌ The page
> editor's content **and** title/emoji autosave both define a save-state of only
> `idle | saving | saved` — **no `failed` variant** — and their `catch` blocks reset
> `saveStatus` / `metaSaveStatus` back to `idle` (`store/document/slices/editor/action.ts`,
> `PageEditor/store/action.ts`). A network / 500 save failure is then indistinguishable from
> a success (only a lock `CONFLICT` is surfaced); the state machine literally can't
> _represent_ failure, so it can never show it — the silent-write trap baked into the type.
> ❌ **Agent profile** shares the identical type-level trap: `AutoSaveHint`'s enum is
> `'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved'` (`components/Editor/AutoSaveHint.tsx`) — **no `failed`** — so
> the header can't show a failed write, and every writer on the surface swallows it: the prompt
> save and `finishStreaming` `catch → console.error` (`routes/(main)/agent/profile/features/store/action.ts`),
> while title / avatar / model / tool / advanced-settings saves surface nothing. A prompt edit
> that failed to persist reads identical to a saved one, with a "saved" tag over it.
> ❌ **Task detail** config autosave is the same trap twice over: `updateVerifyConfig` /
> `updateTaskModelConfig` / `updatePeriodicInterval` / `setAutomationMode` / `updateSchedule` all
> catch-and-`console.error` (`store/task/slices/config/action.ts:121-132,151-167,224-229,279-284`)
> — the optimistic engine reverts the value with **no toast** — and `taskSaveStatus` is
> `saving | saved | idle` with **no `failed`**, reset to `idle` on error (`detail/action.ts:284`),
> while the header renders `AutoSaveHint` only while `saving` (`TaskDetailPage.tsx:68`). A failed
> schedule / verify / model edit looks identical to a saved one.

**Checklist**

- [ ] Save-state surfaced (saving → saved → failed), never a silent write — whether autosave **or** an explicit per-field/section `Save` button (explicit Save still owes the failure signal). _(Certainty)_
- [ ] The save-state enum can **represent** failure — a `failed` variant exists and the write's `catch` drives it, not a reset to `idle` / neutral. _(Certainty)_
- [ ] A failed autosave shows an inline error **with retry** and keeps the edited value. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] One save-feedback convention across a multi-field surface — ideally baked into the shared form wrapper, not re-invented per tab. _(Certainty)_

## 4.5 Error copy is written for a human, not a log line・Meaningful・Certainty

An error surfaced to the user is **product copy**, held to the same bar as any other string
in the UI — yet error paths are where raw internals leak, because the text is often
assembled far from the view (a server lifecycle hook, a `catch` that interpolates the thrown
message) and never passes an i18n file. Three smells mark a message that escaped that bar:

- **Internal ids in the headline** — a raw `tpc_…` / `msg_…` / uuid, a `#N` sequence, an
  operation id. The id is for a **log or an inspect link**, never the sentence the user reads;
  it belongs on a **structured field** (`topicId`, `taskId`) that powers a "View run" affordance,
  not baked into the title. A human reading "topic #1 (tpc\_5UBuAjUU4z6B)" learns nothing and
  distrusts the whole card.
- **Log / stack framing** — `Execution failed: …`, `Error: …`, `[TaskLifecycle]`, a
  prefixed severity. Framing that reads like a console line signals "this wasn't meant for
  you". State what happened in a plain clause; drop the engineering prefix.
- **Redundancy with the surface** — repeating identity the card's meta row already shows
  (the task ref, the agent name). If the row says `T-1 · 标题灵感`, the body headline restating
  `T-1 … error` is noise; the body should carry the _new_ information (what failed, why).

And because the copy is human-facing, it must be **localized** — a server-assembled error
string is English-only and reaches a zh user untranslated. Push the **framing** through
i18n at the view (`t('…error.title')`), keep the stored string a clean English fallback free
of the smells above, and localize the _cause_ too where it maps to a known error type
(don't hand-translate an arbitrary provider message — surface it as honest detail).

> ✅ The HomeInbox error brief headline is localized at the card (`t('inbox.error.title')` →
> "运行失败"), the cause shows as a clean clause, and the topic id rides the structured
> `topicId` field that lights up "View run" (`InboxBriefCard.tsx`,
> `taskLifecycle/index.ts` error brief). ❌ Its prior form baked the lot into the stored
> string — title `` `${taskIdentifier} topic #${seq} (${topicId}) error` `` → **"T-1 topic #1
> (tpc\_5UBuAjUU4z6B) error"**, summary `` `Execution failed: ${raw}` `` — internal id in the
> headline, log framing, task ref duplicated from the meta row, and English-only for every
> locale.

**Checklist**

- [ ] No internal id (`tpc_…` / uuid / `#N` seq / operation id) in the user-facing headline or body — it rides a **structured field** powering an inspect / "View run" link, never the sentence. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] No log / stack framing in the copy — drop `Execution failed:` / `Error:` / `[Module]` prefixes; state what happened as a plain clause. _(Meaningful)_
- [ ] The message doesn't repeat identity the surface's meta row already shows (task ref, agent name) — the body carries the _new_ info (what failed, why). _(Certainty)_
- [ ] Error framing is **localized** through i18n at the view; any server-assembled stored string is a clean English fallback (no id / no log prefix), and a known error _cause_ is localized too. _(Meaningful・Certainty)_
