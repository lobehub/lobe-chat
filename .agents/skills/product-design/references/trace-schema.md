# Trace Schema

The **T** of SCLPT. Without structured evidence, there is no pattern recognition
— just a feeling that the session went well.

A design session leaves three artifacts. Two are for humans. **The third is for
the system**, and it is the one that gets skipped.

| Artifact              | Audience      | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design spec           | reviewers     | What we decided and why                                   |
| Prototype             | reviewers     | What it feels like                                        |
| **Reality-check log** | **the skill** | **What the business overturned — feeds the Pattern Base** |

## The reality-check log

One row per assumption that met the business model. It lives as a section
**inside the spec** — a separate file goes unread.

| Field            | Meaning                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Assumption**   | What was believed, in the words it was believed in                                         |
| **What is true** | The business fact that overturned it, in **domain language**                               |
| **Model**        | Which of Cooper's three models this is a fact about (see [layer-model.md](layer-model.md)) |
| **Verdict**      | `overturned` \| `confirmed` \| `refined`                                                   |
| **Pattern**      | `P-nn` if an existing pattern predicted it; `NEW` if it did not                            |

Two rules keep this honest:

- **"What is true" is written in domain language, not implementation language.**
  Not _"the enum has four values"_ — \*_"the business models four kinds of
  agent-to-human message, and the surface renders one."_ If you cannot state the
  fact without naming a table, it is probably not a product finding at all (see
  [layer-model.md](layer-model.md#which-layer-is-a-given-finding-from)).
- **`NEW` is the whole point.** Every `NEW` row is a hole in the Pattern Base, and
  Step 6 closes it.

### Worked rows — from the session that seeded this skill

| Assumption                                      | What is true                                                                                                                                                                   | Layer          | Verdict    | Pattern      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| The surface only ever has agent errors          | The business models four kinds of agent-to-human message — a decision to rule on, a deliverable to accept, an insight, an error. All four are produced daily; **one is shown** | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-04` |
| `paused` means the user suspended it            | It means **a human is blocking the agent** — pending review. It is the most urgent state on the page, not a "later" bucket                                                     | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-01` |
| "Request changes" leaves a comment              | It **re-tasks the agent**: resolves the item and re-runs it with the comment as input                                                                                          | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-02` |
| "Accept task" is a real action                  | Assignment is immediate and unilateral. There is no "offered, pending acceptance" state — the button implies you could decline, and you cannot                                 | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-05` |
| There is a project concept                      | There is not. The section named "Project" is a knowledge library                                                                                                               | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-03` |
| We can show the team what's being discussed     | Conversations have **no notion of belonging to a member**. Showing them is a domain change, not a layout choice                                                                | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-06` |
| A per-member unread badge is a UI decision      | "Unread" is a property of the conversation, not of a person                                                                                                                    | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-06` |
| Surfacing the unmodeled work needs new plumbing | The business already models "running" and "unread" work; it was simply never asked for                                                                                         | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-10` |
| Elapsed time per run can be shown               | The business does not model a run's duration at all                                                                                                                            | implementation | overturned | NEW → `P-11` |

Nine assumptions, nine overturned, all `NEW` — the **cold-start** signature. A
mature run should be mostly `confirmed`, with one or two `NEW`.

## Reading the log

The shape of the log **is** the diagnosis of the session:

| Shape                                | What it means                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Many `overturned`, all `NEW`         | Cold start. The Pattern Base was blind here — harvest it.                                            |
| Many `overturned`, all citing `P-nn` | Check whether the relevant patterns were read and applied; this may be a process gap.                |
| Mostly `confirmed`, one or two `NEW` | Healthy. The system is working.                                                                      |
| Zero rows                            | Either a trivial surface, or — far more likely — **nobody grounded anything.** Treat with suspicion. |
| Zero `NEW` across a documented round | No new gap was found in the inspected scope; check coverage before shifting effort.                  |

If evidence keeps overturning things the Pattern Base already covers, inspect the
run's pattern selection and application before adding more patterns. Do not assume
the guidance itself is complete or correctly scoped.

## Recording coverage

Name the sources and lifecycle areas checked, unavailable evidence,
contradictions and low-confidence claims. Without this record, zero new findings
is inconclusive rather than a saturation signal.

## Marking debt on the prototype itself

Anything the design shows that the business cannot back gets a visible `NEW` tag
**on the mock**, not just in the spec. A reviewer looking at a picture must be
able to tell which parts are real.

```
Total time on this: 11h 06m   [NEW]   ← the business does not model run duration
```

This is the cheapest defense against `P-05`-class theatre: **if you cannot name
the business event behind an element, you must draw the tag.**

## Why the log, and not just a good memory

The Pattern Base is reviewed long-term guidance; the reality-check log is
task-local evidence. Include the log in a requested spec, or summarize its
material findings in a read-only response. Do not create an artifact solely to
satisfy the process.
