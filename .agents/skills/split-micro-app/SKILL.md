# Micro App: Split, SSR, SEO, Gateway

Canonical living examples, both extracted 2026-08 — read the real files, this skill records
the decisions and landmines, not copies of the code:

- **`apps/workbench`** (`/verify`, `/acceptance`) — all code in this repo, builds and deploys from OSS CI.
- **`apps/share`** (`/share/t/:id`, `/share/page/:id`) — renders Cloud-only surfaces, so it
  builds and deploys from **lobehub-cloud** CI. See §1b before touching it.
- **`apps/auth`** (`/signin`, `/signup`, …) — the SSG variant: `ssr: false` + `prerender`, so
  the worker carries no React at all (7KB). 18 locales x 4 routes of prerendered documents.
  Also renders Cloud-only surfaces (§1b). See §3b.

## Hosting

One app, two serve paths. Do not mix them.

| Surface             | Who serves it                           | Build                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud               | Gateway (torii) → Worker (SSR)          | Cloud Next does **not** `build:spa:<name>`, copy `_spa-<name>`, rewrite to `/spa-<name>`, or CDN-upload that prefix                                                                                 |
| OSS / 子部署 Docker | Next in the same image, client-rendered | `build:docker` runs `build:spa:<name>`; `<NAME>_REQUIRED=1` on `generateSpaTemplates`; Dockerfile copies `apps/<name>/package.json` before `pnpm i` and `public/_spa-<name>` into the runtime image |

`generateSpaTemplates` skips a missing `dist/<name>` HTML unless `<NAME>_REQUIRED=1`. Cloud must skip. Docker must require.

Do not revive Cloud `SPA_TARGET=<name>` Vite builds or a `/spa-<name>` middleware rewrite.

The Docker chain per app, all five links or the route is dead: root `build:docker` script →
`copySpaBuildCore.ts` target entry (`dist/<name>` → `public/_spa-<name>`) → `spaHtmlPaths.ts`
resolver + `generateSpaTemplates` block → `src/app/spa-<name>/[locale]/[[...path]]/route.ts` →
middleware rewrite (`src/libs/next/<name>Routes.ts` + `define-config.ts`) plus the path in
`src/proxy.ts`'s matcher and, for public pages, in `isPublicRoute`.

**Self-hosted loses per-page SSR.** The Next shell serves the built SPA HTML with a brand OG
card and `noindex, nofollow`; per-subject title/OG only exists in the Worker build. That is the
accepted trade, not a bug to chase.

**Dev shells — a 200 that lies.** A `/spa-<name>` handler may only call
`fetchViteDevTemplate('/index.<name>.html')` if that file exists at the repo **root** (workbench
has one; it differs from `apps/<name>/index.html` only in the entry path, which must point at
`/apps/<name>/src/entry.tsx`). Miss it and Vite's HTML fallback answers **200 with the main SPA
shell** — the micro app never loads, nothing errors, and the main SPA no longer has those routes.
An app developed against its own Vite server (share: `dev:spa:share`) carries **no dev branch at
all**. `scripts/spaDevShells.test.ts` guards both directions.

## Crossing from the main SPA

Only markdown internal entity links leave the main SPA (`InternalEntityLink` → `window.location.assign` when `shouldHardNavigateToWorkbench`). `Link` and `useWorkspaceAwareNavigate` stay in-router. Electron never hard-navs (portal). Do not add a `__WORKBENCH__` Vite define — the helper keys off the path (and skips Electron).

Share needed none of this: the only producer builds an **absolute** URL for copy/open
(`${appOrigin}/share/t/${id}` in `SharePopover`), which is already a hard navigation. Before
deleting `src/routes/<x>/**`, grep for in-router links to those paths — a surviving `Link` lands
on the main SPA's 404. Then drop the routes from `desktopRouter.config.tsx` /
`mobileRouter.config.tsx` and update `desktopRouter.sync.test.tsx` + `routeScope.test.ts`.

## 1. Splitting & Artifacts

App layout (`apps/<name>/`):

```
app/            # RR framework mode: root.tsx, routes.ts, entry.server.tsx, routes/, lib/, stubs/
workers/app.ts  # worker entry: API reverse proxy + createRequestHandler
src/            # app-owned features/shell (may coexist with a legacy SPA entry)
vite.config.rr.mts   # RR pipeline; legacy vite.config.ts can coexist (RR CLI: -c vite.config.rr.mts)
wrangler.jsonc  # name, account_id, nodejs_compat, vars (API base / app home)
staticCssOptions.mjs # ONE source for static-css hrefTemplate (vite plugin + emit + dev middleware)
```

Reuse main-src code via `@/*` deep imports + Vite 8 native `resolve.tsconfigPaths: true`
(the vite-tsconfig-paths **plugin** breaks dev SSR module-runner resolution; the app's
tsconfig `include` must cover `app/`). Stack: `@react-router/dev@8` + `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`

- repo Vite 8 (rolldown) — officially compatible.

**SSR bundle weight is the whole battle.** Main-src imports drag the app universe
(store web → chat/agent/electron). Tools and cuts, in order:

| Tool / cut                    | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| SSR-stub store hubs           | vite `resolveId` stubs per env (`app/stubs/`): trpc client, services/global, store/electron, store/file, store/user, i18n loader. Stubs must be **callable empty-state hooks**, not throwing proxies — render paths call them. Keep the implemented surface explicit (no catch-all `Proxy` / `as never`): `stubSurfaceGuard` in `vite.config.rr.mts` fails the build when the graph imports an export or member the stub does not implement. Add the member (empty / `reject`) or keep the importer off the graph. |
| Client-shim lambda            | Client `@/libs/trpc/client` is a cookie-only `httpLink` (`trpcClient.client.ts`). Do not ship the real `lambda.ts` — its `headers()` pulls image store → chat store + `model-bank` catalog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Share's cuts took SSR from **9.84MB → 1.78MB gzip**. Two build-level snags worth knowing:
`resolve.dedupe` must include `@lobehub/ui` (the `builtin-tool-*` packages declare a loose `^5`
and resolve to an older copy whose base-ui lacks components the app renders → `MISSING_EXPORT:
Alert`), and a `*.client` module needs its own SSR-env stub so the hydration gate does not drag
the gated tree into the worker anyway.

Products: `build/client` (assets → CDN), `build/server` (worker; deploy with
`wrangler deploy --config build/server/wrangler.json`). Budget: worker gzip ≤ 10MB paid.

**CI affected-detection**: build emits `build-inputs.txt` (module-graph file list, gitignored);
the deploy workflow diffs changed files against the manifest from the **last successful run's
artifact** (carry-forward on skip), plus meta triggers (app dir, plugins/vite, lockfile,
tsconfig, glob dirs). New `import.meta.glob` patterns in shared code need a new meta trigger —
the one manual rule. See `apps/workbench/scripts/should-build.mjs` +
`.github/workflows/deploy-workbench.yml`; the overlay-hosted variant is lobehub-cloud's
`scripts/shouldBuildShare.ts` + `.github/workflows/deploy-share.yml` (§1b).

**PR-time verify is a separate workflow per repo that can change the artifact** — deploy
ownership (§1b) does not decide verify ownership. Each verify builds the worker, uploads a
non-deployed preview **version** (`wrangler versions upload --preview-alias`, dry-run when
secrets are absent), enforces the 8MB-gzip guard, and comments the preview URL behind an HTML
marker (never `--edit-last` — other workflows comment as the same bot). Workbench: one repo,
one `verify-workbench.yml`. Share: **both** repos, because either side's change flows into the
deployed worker — OSS `verify-share.yml` + cloud `verify-share.yml`.

**Previews upload to a sibling Worker, never to the production script.** Cloudflare only rolls
back to the **100 most recently uploaded versions** of a script, and preview uploads count: at
share's PR rate (10 uploads in under an hour on a busy day) every real deployment left the
window within a day, which broke the gateway admin's (鳥居番) rollback list. So every verify
passes `--name lobehub-<name>-preview`, and the production script's version list holds only
deployments. Two consequences: the preview Worker must exist before the first upload
(`wrangler versions upload` refuses a never-deployed script — bootstrap it once with
`wrangler deploy --name lobehub-<name>-preview` from any stub; the next upload replaces it),
and the preview API token must be allowed to edit the `-preview` name. Preview URLs are then
`https://<alias>-lobehub-<name>-preview.lobeobjects-tg.workers.dev`, and `VITE_CDN_BASE` must
point at that same origin. Alias namespaces must not collide on the shared preview worker: OSS
uses `pr<N>`, cloud uses `cloudpr<N>`. Manifest source
differs by what the repo can read: cloud verify borrows the deploy's `share-deploy-state`
artifact (same repo); OSS verify cannot read cloud artifacts, so it self-bootstraps from its
own last successful run's `share-build-inputs` (first run always builds).

## 1b. When the surface renders Cloud-only code

`lobehub-cloud` includes this repo as a submodule at `lobehub/` and shadows it path-by-path
through tsconfig `paths` (`@/business/*` → `./src/business/*` then `./lobehub/src/business/*`;
`@/*` → `./src/*` then `./lobehub/src/*`). Split by **ownership**, not by which repo is handy:

`apps/auth` is the cheap case: because `ssr: false` ships no render graph, the Cloud overlay
(BusinessAuthProvider → Turnstile + referral) added **one chunk and 0 extra SSR stubs** —
measured at 585.7KB gz eager vs 587.3KB for the open-source build, with byte-identical markup.
Do not assume that; `apps/share` needed 8.2MB of stubbing. Measure per app.

| Rendering surfaces only Cloud implements                                  | Stays in Cloud. OSS keeps the `@/business/*` stub (`return null` / passthrough, real types); the app imports the seam |
| SSR stubs for Cloud-only store hubs                                       | Cloud (`apps/<name>/stubs/*`), injected into the shared config                                                        |

The RR config is a **factory** so both hosts share one pipeline:
`apps/share/vite.config.shared.mts` exports
`createShareRrConfig({ appRoot, extraSsrStubs, repoRoot, resolvePlugins, staticCss })`, and the
OSS `vite.config.rr.mts` is a thin caller reading `SHARE_TSCONFIG_PROJECT` /
`SHARE_EXTRA_SSR_STUBS`. Cloud fills both in `scripts/shareApp.ts` and drives the submodule app
through `scripts/{buildShare,devShare,deployShare,shouldBuildShare}.ts`.

**Landmine — the overlay silently doesn't apply.** Vite 8's native `resolve.tsconfigPaths`
resolves against the tsconfig _nearest each importer_, so submodule files resolve through the
submodule's own tsconfig and the host overlay is lost. The build still succeeds and ships the
open-source fallback surfaces (for share: a blank page). An overlay build must use the
`vite-tsconfig-paths` **plugin** pinned to the host tsconfig and switch the native one off
(`tsconfigPaths: !resolvePlugins`). Both settings are right in their own context — native for
the standalone build, plugin for the overlay build. Verify by grepping `build-inputs.txt` for a
Cloud-only file.

**Whoever's code must be inside the artifact owns the build.** Share deploys from
lobehub-cloud (`.github/workflows/deploy-share.yml`), not OSS. Never add a deploy workflow to a
repo that can only produce the fallback.

**OSS PRs can still verify with the real overlay.** Same-repo OSS PRs clone the overlay repo @
HEAD via `.github/actions/business-overlay` (the clone+overlay step extracted from
`desktop-build-setup`: overlay files land in `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/..`, which works because the
repo is named `lobehub` so the checkout already sits at the submodule path), then
`cd .. && pnpm install` and run the overlay repo's own `bun run build:share` — the tsconfig /
stub knowledge stays over there. **The OSS workflow never hardcodes the private repo
name**: it comes from the Actions repository variable `OVERLAY_REPOSITORY`; the token reuses
the pre-existing `LOBEHUB_CLOUD_TOKEN` secret (deliberately not renamed — the desktop release
workflows already reference it, and a rename would mean reconfiguring the org secret). When
either is unset (fork PRs always), the workflow falls back to the
OSS-stub build + wrangler dry-run as a pure compile/size guard. Keep new public-facing CI
wording on the neutral "business overlay" vocabulary — the older desktop release workflows
still leak the internal naming and are the known remaining exception. One trap: an overlay
build's `build-inputs.txt` is overlay-root-relative (`repoRoot =
dirname(SHARE_TSCONFIG_PROJECT)`), so OSS files appear as `lobehub/src/...` — strip that
prefix before exact-matching against the OSS repo's own diff (`sed 's#^lobehub/##'` in the
verify workflow); the meta triggers already match both spellings.

**Cloud affected-detection needs submodule history**: a bump is a single `lobehub` entry in the
host diff, so the workflow runs `git -C lobehub fetch --unshallow` and compares the previous
submodule SHA (carried in the state artifact) before diffing against `build-inputs.txt`.

**Re-run the module trace in the Cloud build** — the overlay adds chains OSS never sees
(`ShareAppShell → @/store/serverConfig/Provider → … → @/store/workspace → workspaceBootstrap →
@/store/home → @/store/chat` cost 8.2MB gzip until stubbed).

**Merge order**: OSS PR → submodule bump → Cloud PR. Until the OSS PR lands, anything deployed
from a local submodule mirror is not reproducible from any commit — say so when handing over.

## 2. Deploy: CDN Assets + Worker

Assets follow the cloud convention (`resolveViteBase`): **stable prefix, no version stamp** —
`VITE_CDN_BASE=https://web-assets.lobehub.com/<name>/`; content-hashed filenames make uploads
incremental and immutable. The prefix axis is the **app**, nothing else: do not invent
`<name>-oss` / `<name>-cloud` variants to separate build origins — hashed filenames already make
one prefix safe for all of them. `ASSET_S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is an origin; any path segment belongs
on `ASSET_BASE_URL` instead. `bun run deploy` (see `apps/workbench/scripts/deploy.ts`) =
build with CDN base → upload `build/client/assets` to R2 (`web-assets` bucket, LobeHub
account) → `wrangler deploy`. R2 creds: 1Password Shared vault item "CI R2 - web-assets".
CI injects repo secrets `ASSET_S3_*` (`ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BUCKET`,
`ENDPOINT`, `REGION`, `PUBLIC_DOMAIN`). Local `bun run deploy` can fall back to `MOBILE_S3_*`.
Never echo values.

Worker responsibilities beyond SSR: reverse-proxy `/api|/oidc|/trpc|/webapi` to
`WORKBENCH_API_BASE` (standalone mode; behind the gateway the browser hits the apex and the
gateway routes API to `app` instead), and redirect `/` + unknown paths to `WORKBENCH_APP_HOME`.

## 3. SSR

- **Loader-side data**: per-request tRPC client (`httpLink` + superjson + forwarded `cookie`
  header, base from wrangler vars via `cloudflareContext`) — the browser lambdaClient is
  SSR-stubbed. Inject into SWR with `<SWRConfig value={{ fallback: { [unstable_serialize(key)]: data } }}>`;
  key must equal `useClientDataSWR`'s (augmentKey passes through when workspaceId is null).
- **`isLoading && !data`**: with SWRConfig fallback, `isLoading` is true during mount
  revalidation — a bare `if (isLoading)` swaps SSR content for a spinner after hydration.
- **i18n**: narrow to the namespaces the app renders; root loader preloads locale resources,
  i18n inits sync (`initAsync: false`) with bundled resources; SSR env stubs the shared glob
  loader to only its namespaces (full glob = every locale × ns as worker chunks).
- **CSS three layers**: lobe-ui `static-css` (antd probes + theme vars, hrefTemplate from the
  shared options file; emitted as hashed files, dev served by config middleware) →
  antd-style `extractStaticStyle(html, { includeAntd: false })` for emotion →
  `buildInlineAntdStyle(cache, { styleKeys })` fallback. Non-streaming render
  (`await stream.allReady`) so extraction is complete.
- `<html suppressHydrationWarning>` — next-themes stamps `data-theme` pre-hydration.
- **Time-dependent output must be client-gated**: relative timestamps and anything else the
  server and client compute differently belong behind a `useHydrated()`
  (`useSyncExternalStore`) check, not in the SSR pass.
- **Skeletons must not swallow SSR'd chrome — and must hold its position.** A list that flips
  to a skeleton on mount blanks the server-rendered header with it: render the header slot in
  the skeleton branch too. Presence is not enough — every phase (no-JS SSR fallback,
  post-hydration skeleton, settled list) must put that chrome in the **same layout container**
  as the final render, or the page jumps sideways when JS lands. Share's hero shipped left-flush
  while the settled list centered it in a `min(960px, 100%)` column, twice: the SSR fallback
  rendered `ShareHero` bare, and ChatList's `showSkeleton` branch rendered `headerSlot` outside
  `WideScreenContainer`. Verify by measuring the element's `getBoundingClientRect().x` across
  all three phases (stall the messages request to pin the skeleton phase), not by eyeballing
  one screenshot.
- **Preload the `error` namespace**, not just the render ones. The boundary shows exactly when a
  chunk failed to load — precisely when the client can no longer fetch a dictionary — and an
  untranslated boundary prints raw keys (`error.title`…). Cost for share: +6.3KB gzip/document.
- **Prefilling a virtualized list**: `virtua` caches measured sizes by index, so a _truncated_
  prefill that later grows misaligns every row. Prefill the whole list or none of it.

## 3b. Prerendering instead of SSR (`ssr: false`)

When every page is config-free at render time, `ssr: false` + `prerender` drops the whole SSR
bundle-weight battle: no stubs, no client gates, and the worker is a static picker.
`apps/auth`'s is \~7KB — it resolves the locale, fetches one document out of the assets binding,
and swaps a `window.__SERVER_CONFIG__` placeholder for the deployment's config.

- **Runtime config cannot be baked.** The build has no deployment's env, so the document is
  prerendered config-free and the worker injects it. Anything that reads it must be hydration-
  gated (`useIsHydrated`), or the first client render diverges from the document.
- **Audit what actually needs to travel that way — most of it does not.** The hydration gate
  applies to the _whole_ injected object, so every value routed through it is a value missing
  from the prerendered HTML. In `apps/auth` the config carried 11 fields; the pages read 6, and
  the most visible one was in the wrong layer entirely: `enableBusinessFeatures` is a
  **build-time constant** (`@lobechat/business-const`, `false` open-source / `true` in Cloud via
  a pnpm override) that was being round-tripped through the server, and with it the SSO provider
  list — itself a hardcoded array in the Cloud overlay. Reading the constant directly instead
  put Google/GitHub/Apple into the static document. `featureFlags`, `enableMarketTrustedClient`,
  `telemetry` and `aiProvider` had zero consumers and were dropped from the endpoint, which is
  public and unauthenticated. Do this audit before accepting "config-dependent UI pops in after
  hydration" as the cost of prerendering.
- **Prerendering turns every `localStorage` read during render into a hydration bug.** A
  returning user's stored state (`useState(readStored)`) makes the first client render disagree
  with a document that was built without it — `apps/auth` hit this twice, on the terms checkbox
  and on the "last used" provider badge, both of which also reorder the buttons. Move them to
  `useState(empty)` + `useEffect`. A fresh browser will not reproduce it; seed the keys and
  reload.
- **The config needs an endpoint.** A worker has no access to the app's env; `apps/auth` reads
  `GET /webapi/auth/spa-config` (public, `s-maxage`) through the API base and tolerates failure
  by leaving the placeholder in place.
- **Landmine — one document per locale must live at the canonical path.** Prerendering
  `/:locale/signin` and serving it at `/signin` looks like it works and silently breaks
  hydration: React Router matches the plain route, finds no context for the prefixed route id,
  and React re-renders the whole document — leaving **two copies of the page in the DOM**, with
  no console warning. Only the second one is visible, so a screenshot looks fine; count
  `document.querySelectorAll('form')` to catch it. The fix is one build pass per locale
  (`AUTH_PRERENDER_LOCALE` → `environments.ssr.define`), each prerendering the same canonical
  paths, with the non-default passes' documents folded into `build/client/__i18n/<locale>/`.
  Keep the locale out of the **client** define so every pass emits byte-identical assets —
  `scripts/build.mjs` asserts that by resolving each copied document's asset refs against the
  default build.
- **The matrix costs build time, not bytes — and it parallelizes.** `apps/auth` runs all 18
  locales for 73 documents and 17.8MB in `build/client`, with **no change to first load**
  (640.8KB gz over the same 34 eager files: the per-locale dictionary chunks are lazy and each
  document carries only its own). The non-default passes share nothing and write to their own
  `build-<locale>`, so they fan out: **3m05s sequential → 44s at 6 concurrent** on 16 cores.
  Each pass costs about two cores; past \~6 it stops paying (9 concurrent measured 42s, with
  per-pass time rising 12s → 16s). `AUTH_BUILD_CONCURRENCY` overrides the
  `min(6, availableParallelism() - 2)` default, which lands on 2 for a 4-vCPU CI runner —
  budget \~2min there, and mind that `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size` applies per child.
  If that is still too slow, the remaining move is one build plus N renders against
  `build/server/index.js` with the locale threaded through `entry.server.tsx` — that trades the
  build-time define for request state, so it needs `AsyncLocalStorage` or strict sequencing.
  Verify RTL locales (`ar`, `fa-IR`) in a browser — they exercise the antd direction path that
  no LTR document touches.
- **The prerender list is loaded by plain Node** (`react-router.config.ts`), so it cannot import
  anything alias-resolved and has to be a literal array. Guard it against the dictionaries on
  disk in the build script, or a newly translated locale silently prerenders as English.
- **i18n must be synchronous for the served locale.** A resources-to-backend fetch renders
  English first and swaps a tick later, which is a hydration mismatch against a prerendered
  zh-CN document. Bundling every locale into the client instead costs a lot (auth: 63KB gz of
  dictionaries, eagerly modulepreloaded on every route), so `apps/auth` inlines **only the
  served locale** into the document as `<script type="application/json">` and keeps the others
  behind an on-demand backend for the language switcher. Weigh it: that moved 44KB gz off the
  JS path but put 22KB gz onto the document, which is the one thing first paint waits for, and
  the dictionary is now re-sent per document instead of cached once. A per-locale hashed JS
  file loaded by a blocking script would beat both; nobody has built it yet.
- **The client build must stay locale-agnostic** for the one-pass-per-locale scheme to share
  assets, so anything that reads the dictionaries needs a server/client twin: the prerender
  module holds every bundle, the `.client` twin reads the document's inlined JSON, and
  `vite.config.shared.mts` swaps them per environment. `meta()` runs on both sides — it goes
  through the same twin, not a second copy of the strings.
- **`resolve.noExternal: true` on the ssr env, build only.** The prerender pass runs the built
  server bundle through plain Node, which rejects the extensionless directory imports some
  published `es/` bundles ship (`@lobehub/fluent-emoji`). Setting it for `serve` too breaks the
  dev module runner on inlined CJS (`module is not defined`, then `require is not defined`) —
  and leaving it off leaves `react-router dev` 500ing on that same directory import. **Known
  gap:** `apps/auth`'s dev server does not run; the working local loop is
  `bun run build && wrangler dev`.

## 4. SEO

One shared builder (`app/lib/seo.ts` → `buildPageMeta`): title, description, robots,
og:title/description/type/site\_name/locale (underscore form)/image(+alt), twitter card set.
Rules: leaf `meta` **fully replaces** root meta — every leaf returns the whole set;
`og:image` must be an **absolute URL** (reuse landing's `https://lobehub.com/assets/cao-og.webp`);
dynamic title/description come from the route loader (subject title · BRANDING\_NAME,
requirement text truncated \~200 chars).

## 5. Gateway Routing (torii, `../lobehub-gateway`)

Config = KV `config:lobehub.com`, mirrored in `config/entrypoints/lobehub.com/<env>.json`.
To add a micro app:

1. `targets.<name>` = worker hostname (must be cross-zone, e.g. `*.workers.dev`; https).
2. `targetPolicies.<name>` — `cookies` if SSR loaders need the `.lobehub.com` session
   forwarded; `none` for public-only; `all` adds Authorization. Add `"locale": "query"` when the
   app reads `?hl=` (share does).
3. `rules` — first-match path prefixes (`{ "match": "/acceptance", "target": "<name>" }`).
   Leave `/trpc` unruled: it falls to `default` (app) so browser API calls stay same-origin
   authenticated. `.data` suffix is normalized before matching.
4. Validate: `bun run test` in the gateway repo (invariant suite reads the mirror).
5. Staging: `bun scripts/torii.ts push --env staging --expect <fp>` (needs TORII\_ACCESS\_\*),
   or poke staging KV directly (`wrangler kv key put --namespace-id <staging CONFIG ns>`) —
   README-sanctioned. Prod writes only via the Toriiban (鳥居番) admin **Promote** button:
   `torii.ts promote` prints the exact delta and refuses to write, and
   `push --env prod --confirm-prod` exists but bypasses a deliberate human gate — don't.
   Before promoting, `pull --env prod` (repo mirrors go stale — a mirror-vs-live diff is not
   drift), run the invariant suite, and re-run `verify --env staging`.
6. Verify with staging debug headers: `x-torii-target` / `x-torii-decision` per request, and
   test document + `.data` + unaffected routes.
7. Rollback and previews live in 鳥居番's target detail pane, in a **Worker** card that every
   target whose host is in the gateway repo's `bindings.ts` gets for free. **Releases** lists
   the production script's Cloudflare deployments; a row is only rollbackable while its
   version is within Cloudflare's 100-upload window — which is the reason previews stay off
   the production script (§1). **Previews** lists the `-preview` Worker's versions (PR label
   and actor come from the `--message` stamp) with Open and, under staging, **Set override**,
   which writes the preview host into the target's `targetOverrides` immediately (a saved,
   history-recorded config write — no editor Save). Adding a micro app to `bindings.ts` is
   therefore part of wiring it into the gateway.

Landmine (fixed 2026-08, stay aware): the lobehub-com `react-router-data` plugin owns `.data`
protocol affinity for the landing pair; it consults `resolveRule` and lets other targets'
`.data` fall through — if a future entrypoint clones that plugin, keep the fall-through.

## Checklist for a new micro app

1. Decide ownership first (§1b): does the surface render Cloud-only code? That fixes which repo
   builds, deploys, and holds the extra SSR stubs.
2. Scaffold `apps/<name>` (copy workbench/share shapes); routes + root + entry.server + worker.
3. Build, run the module trace, cut SSR weight (gate/stub/slot/deep-import) until gzip sane —
   in the overlay repo too, if there is one.
4. Wire CDN deploy (`deploy.ts`, stable `_<name>/` prefix) + wrangler vars + redirects, plus a
   PR-time verify workflow in **every repo whose changes reach the artifact** (§1 PR-time
   verify — preview version on the bootstrapped `lobehub-<name>-preview` Worker, size guard,
   non-colliding alias namespace).
5. Loader data + SWR fallback + meta builder + i18n narrowing (+ `error`); verify with
   `/trpc`-blocked browser run (content must survive) and view-source (SSR content + meta present).
6. Deploy worker; verify workers.dev standalone (API proxy, `/` redirect).
7. Gateway: target + policy + rules on staging KV; curl matrix with x-torii headers; promote.
8. OSS Docker: all five links in the Hosting section, plus the removal sweep from the main SPA.
9. Cloud Next: no Vite target, no `/spa-<name>` rewrite, no `_spa-<name>` CDN upload.

## Verifying, before you tell anyone it works

Build success proves nothing about what rendered. Each of these produced a real defect that a
green build hid: the overlay resolving to OSS stubs, the dev shell answering 200 with the wrong
app, an edit that silently no-op'd because the anchor string had drifted (deployed a 500 —
so: build → local `wrangler dev` → browser → _then_ deploy), and a "fix" asserted from the
source instead of the page. Prove the Docker chain by running `build:spa:<name>` +
`<NAME>_REQUIRED=1 build:spa:copy` and asserting every asset the generated template references
exists under `public/`; prove the SSR page by viewing source, not by reading the loader.
