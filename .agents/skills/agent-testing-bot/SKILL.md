# Agent Testing — Bot Channels (LobeHub project skill)

This skill **extends** the generic `acceptance` skill (installed alongside at
`../acceptance/`) to the bot-channel surfaces. It does NOT replace the core
process: the same three phases apply —

```text
PLAN (Steps 0–2) → EXECUTE (Steps 3–6) → FINISH (Step 7)
```

— and the same report + publish pipeline (`result.json` → `report-init.sh` →
`lh acceptance run ingest … --source agent-testing`). Read the acceptance skill's
`SKILL.md` for target grounding, the living logs, the Phase-1 approval gate, the
report format, and teardown. This file only adds the bot-channel surface.

For LobeHub environment/auth/probe specifics (dev server, seeded account, ports),
the adapter is `.agents/acceptance/PROJECT.md`.

## When this surface applies

| Change scope                                   | Surface                           | Why                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bot channels** (Discord / WeChat / Lark / …) | Native app via osascript / bridge | Only way to exercise the real channel end-to-end |

Route here only when the behavior under test is a bot channel. For CLI / Web /
Electron changes, use the generic skill's surfaces.

## Platforms

Each platform folder has an `index.md` (activation, navigation, send-message,
verification snippets) and a `test-<platform>-bot.sh` driver.

| Platform      | Guide                                    | Quick switcher        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Discord       | [discord/index.md](./discord/index.md)   | `Cmd+K`               |
| Slack         | [slack/index.md](./slack/index.md)       | `Cmd+K`               |
| Telegram      | [telegram/index.md](./telegram/index.md) | `Cmd+F`               |
| WeChat / 微信 | [wechat/index.md](./wechat/index.md)     | `Cmd+F`               |
| Lark / 飞书   | [lark/index.md](./lark/index.md)         | `Cmd+K`               |
| QQ            | [qq/index.md](./qq/index.md)             | `Cmd+F`               |
| iMessage      | [imessage/index.md](./imessage/index.md) | bridge (no osascript) |

## Shared driver contract

Every osascript platform script shares one interface:

```bash
./$PLATFORM/test-$PLATFORM-bot.sh $CHANNEL_OR_CONTACT $MESSAGE [$WAIT_SECONDS] [$SCREENSHOT_PATH]
```

The script activates the app, navigates to the channel/contact, sends the
message, waits, and screenshots the result window (via the generic skill's
`../../acceptance/scripts/capture-app-window.sh`). iMessage is the exception: it
uses a BlueBubbles bridge, not osascript — see [imessage/index.md](./imessage/index.md).

## osascript prerequisites

The osascript platforms drive real macOS apps (activate, keystroke, click, read
accessibility, screenshot). Read the generic skill's general macOS-automation
reference before a first bot run:
[../../acceptance/references/osascript.md](../../acceptance/references/osascript.md).
The target native app must already be running and logged in.

## Screen-recording gate (macOS-only)

Bot evidence is captured with OS-level `screencapture` (through
`capture-app-window.sh`), NOT CDP — so it comes out **entirely black** when macOS
Screen Recording (TCC) permission is missing OR the display is asleep / locked /
on a screensaver. Gate BEFORE any bot capture:

```bash
./.agents/acceptance/scripts/check-screen-recording.sh # exit 0 = OS capture will work
```

Keep the display awake for the whole capture session (`caffeinate -dimsu &`, kill
when done). Because this surface depends on OS capture and native macOS apps,
**bot channels are macOS-only — they do not run headless / in cloud.**
