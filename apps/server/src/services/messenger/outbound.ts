/**
 * Outbound-only DM delivery for the System Bot, deliberately kept off
 * `MessengerRouter`.
 *
 * The router owns the *inbound* path: `loadBot` builds a Chat SDK bot and runs
 * `registerHandlers`, which needs `AgentBridgeService` — a top-level import, so
 * merely referencing the module pulls the entire agent runtime (sharp, pdf /
 * epub / office parsers, the AI SDKs, Stripe, …) into every serverless function
 * that can reach it. Sending one DM needs none of that: a bot token and the
 * platform's own REST call are enough. The attachment helpers imported above
 * are plain fetch/REST utilities with the same footprint.
 *
 * WeChat is absent here because it already had its own direct path
 * (`wechatPush.ts` → `WechatApiClient`); this brings the other three platforms
 * in line with it.
 *
 * Inbound handling is unaffected and still goes through the router.
