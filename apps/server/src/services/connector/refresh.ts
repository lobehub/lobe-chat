 * - **Failure backoff**: a failed sync leaves the attempt recorded, so a down
 *   connector is retried at most once per TTL instead of every message.

 * only re-fetch on the manual Refresh button / OAuth callback, so a user's tool
 * list stays frozen at install time until they re-sync by hand (the "必须手动进技能
 * 管理更新" complaint). This reinstates that freshness at the tool-call / chat-run
 * boundary:
 *
 * - **HTTP connectors only** — stdio servers must spawn on the user's own machine,
 *   not the cloud server, so we never auto-connect them here.
 * - **Throttled** to one sync per connector per {@link CONNECTOR_TOOLS_REFRESH_TTL_MS}
 *   using the tools' own `updatedAt` as the last-sync marker (no schema change).
 * - **Deferred** via `after()` so it runs past the response — zero added latency.
 *   Refreshed tools therefore take effect on the *next* run, which is fine for a
 *   background freshness sweep, and failures are swallowed (never user-facing).
