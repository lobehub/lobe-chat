/**
 * Which arg carries the working directory for the APIs that consume one. The
 * model never picks the working directory — the system prompt's
 * `{{workingDirectory}}` tells it where it is — so the runtime injects it as the
 * tool call's cwd/scope. `executeToolCall` only forwards `arguments`, so it must
 * ride in the args; the daemon otherwise falls back to `process.cwd()` (= `/`
 * for a Finder/Dock-launched app):
 *
 * - `runCommand → cwd`: the manifest deliberately hides `cwd`, but the daemon
 *   spawns in `params.cwd`.
 * - file ops (`readFile`/`writeFile`/`editFile`/`moveFiles`) → `cwd`:
 *   the daemon resolves a relative `path`/`file_path`/move item against
 *   `params.cwd` (see `resolveAgainstCwd`), so a model-supplied relative path
 *   lands in the bound directory instead of `/`. Absolute paths ignore it.
 * - search ops (`searchFiles`/`globFiles`/`grepContent`) → `scope`: their
 *   manifest claims `scope` "defaults to the working directory", but the daemon
 *   falls back to `process.cwd()`. Inject `scope` so that promise holds.
 *
 * APIs that act on a command id (getCommandOutput / killCommand) take neither.
