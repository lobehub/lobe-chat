/**
 * On operation completion, scan every file edited during the operation (and its
 * sub-operations), and register each ENTITY-format file (pptx/xlsx/docx/pdf, …)
 * as a `file` Work — exactly one new version per operation, its content exported
 * from the sandbox and persisted so the version has a durable, fetchable URL.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - A ROOT operation scans the whole operation tree so a sub-agent's edits are
 *   captured, registering the tree exactly once. A SUB-op normally returns early
 *   (the root already covers it), EXCEPT an auto-repair op whose parent is
 *   already terminal — the parent will never re-scan, so the repair registers
 *   just its OWN edits (a new version). See the scan-scope block below.
 * - HTML / other files are skipped: HTML rides the artifact-hosting path and the
 *   rest fold into the frontend's aggregate "edited N files" card.
 * - Besides scanned EDITS, successfully `exportFile`-d entity paths register
 *   too: binary entity formats are produced by sandbox code execution (not by
 *   the text-based write/edit tools), so the export call is the only persisted
 *   record carrying their path. Both export surfaces count — the sandbox
 *   tool's `exportFile` and the skills tool's (`lobe-skills`) `exportFile`.
 * - `deleted` files are skipped (nothing to persist).
 * - One version per operation via the dedup key `op:${operationId}`; a retry of
 *   the same operation is idempotent — an existence probe short-circuits before
 *   re-exporting, and the `(workId, toolCallId)` unique guard backs it up.
 * - Best-effort per file: an export or registration failure for one file is
 *   logged and skipped, never aborting the others.
 *
 * Besides file Works, the SAME collected records feed the shell github Work
 * scan (`registerShellWorks`): heterogeneous CLI shells (codex /
 * claude-code) and the device `lobe-local-system` tool run `gh issue|pr
 * create/edit` outside the skill-tool registration hook, so their github
 * entities are recovered here at completion time and — for hetero runs, which
 * never pass `callLlmFinalizer` — the Work display anchor is stamped onto the
 * round's final assistant message.
 *
 * Returns a {@link WorksRegistrationOutcome} summary (`attempted` / `failed`)
 * so the caller can gate its idempotency marker: because each file is wrapped in
 * its own try/catch and folded through `mapWithConcurrency` (a bounded
 * allSettled), this function NEVER rejects on a per-file failure — the counts are
 * the only signal a caller has that some files did not register. A run with
 * `failed > 0` must leave the marker unset so a later call retries (the per-file
 * DB probe short-circuits the ones that already succeeded). The early no-op paths
 * (no topic / no records / no candidates) return `attempted: 0, failed: 0`.
 *
 * Awaited (not fire-and-forget) by the completion lifecycle so a serverless
 * response freeze can't drop the background write; the caller still swallows any
 * whole-function rejection so Work registration can never affect operation
 * completion.
