 *      (no group / channel handling), so the "external user @s the bot in
 *      a group" attack surface from doesn't exist on this
 *      platform today.
 *   2. The platform's settings schema has no `userId` field, so an owner
 *      ID can't be configured even if we wanted to gate on it.
 *
 * For these platforms we treat the sender as trusted because there is no
 * group-chat fan-out path — every message is a direct conversation with
 * the bound account. The trade-off: messages from contacts of the bound
 * account also flow through; that's the accepted personal-scope risk.
 *
 * **Add a platform here only when both conditions hold.** Platforms that
 * support groups but lack a `userId` field (e.g. LINE today) MUST stay out
 * of this set — fix the schema first.
