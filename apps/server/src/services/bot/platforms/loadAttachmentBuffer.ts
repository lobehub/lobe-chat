 * This is a worker-memory guard, not a platform policy cap.
 *
 * On the PUSH path, per-platform limits are applied upstream by
 * `prepareAttachmentsForBudget`, which degrades anything over budget to a
 * download link before the bytes are ever fetched — so this cap should never
 * be the thing that stops a push.
 *
 * The agent-facing `botMessage` procedures do NOT go through that pass: the
 * router hands raw attachments straight to the platform services. There, an
 * oversized body is refused here and the sender skips the attachment, which
 * means it is dropped without a fallback link. That gap is tracked separately —
 * routing those sends through the budget pass is a change to the agent tool
 * contract, not something to bolt on inside this loader.
