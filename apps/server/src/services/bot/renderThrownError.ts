 * Render a thrown value as a user-facing IM failure reply.
 *
 * The bot's failure paths that catch a raw `Error` (bridge startup, the
 * handleMention / router catch-alls) used to render `renderError(operationId)`,
 * which produces a bare "**Agent Execution Failed**" — and, when the operation
 * never got far enough to have an id, not even that (a Discord thread report
 * showed two consecutive failures carrying no information at all).
 *
 * Running the value through the runtime's own error normalizer first gives
 * those paths the same `errorType` + `attribution` the completion path already
 * receives from the lifecycle event, so `renderAgentError` can pick curated
 * copy ("Something went wrong on our side…", "Model provider temporarily
 * unavailable…") instead of the opaque legacy template.
 *
 * The raw message is passed only as a matching signal — `renderAgentError`
 * never emits it (see the legacy-tier comment there).
