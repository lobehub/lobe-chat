 * self-reflection / self-feedback-intent / memory) to an optional caller
 * callback so side-effects (receipt projection) can happen asynchronously after
 * the agent run finishes.
 *
 * Routing is keyed on the marker-derived `selfIteration` payload, NOT the agent
 * slug: a memory-writer run executes as the user's own agent, so a slug check
 * would miss it. The marker is the authoritative "this run wants completion-side
 * projection" signal, stamped by the dispatcher.
 *
 * The callback is fire-and-forget from the worker's perspective; failures are
 * logged but never re-trigger the source pipeline.
