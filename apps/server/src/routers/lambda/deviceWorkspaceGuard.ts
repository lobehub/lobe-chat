 * Validate that a client-supplied workspace root is actually one the user has
 * bound to this device.
 *
 * The file routes (move / rename / write / preview) receive `workingDirectory`
 * from the same untrusted browser session that supplies the file paths. The
 * gateway's `assertPathsWithinWorkspace` only proves the paths sit *inside that
 * directory* — it never proves the directory itself is legitimate. So a caller
 * could set `workingDirectory` to `/` (or `C:\`), pass that containment check
 * trivially, and reach any path on the device.
 *
 * To close that hole we re-derive the approved roots from the *server-owned*
 * device row — the `workingDirs` recent list and `defaultCwd`, both written only
 * via `device.updateDevice` / the run path, never trusted from this request —
 * and require the requested root to equal or nest inside one of them before any
 * RPC is forwarded. The picker upserts every chosen directory into `workingDirs`
 * (see `useCommitWorkingDirectory`) and run start upserts the bound cwd, so a
 * legitimately-selected workspace is always present here.

 * Enforce the workspace device-visibility boundary for RPC routes.

 * member holding another member's private deviceId (cached response,
 * pre-demotion state) could still drive tool/git/file RPCs against that
 * machine. Called once from `deviceProcedure` for every route that takes a
 * `deviceId` input: a workspace-scoped call against a device hidden from the
 * caller fails closed with the same NOT_FOUND an unknown device produces.
 *
 * The visible registry row is also the workspace execution authority. A live
 * Gateway connection without that row can be a stale process that missed an
 * Unshare RPC, so it must fail exactly like an unknown or private device.
 *
 * Use when:
 * - A workspace-scoped RPC accepts a client-supplied logical device ID
 *
 * Expects:
 * - `deviceModel` is already scoped to the authorized workspace and caller
 *
 * Returns:
 * - Nothing for a visible registered device; otherwise throws `NOT_FOUND`
