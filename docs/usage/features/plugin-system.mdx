The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeChat assistant.

By utilizing plugins, LobeChat assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

### Roadmap Progress

The plugin system of LobeChat has now entered a stable stage, and we have basically completed most of the functionality required by the plugin system. However, we are still planning and considering the new possibilities that plugins can bring to us. You can learn more in the following Issues:

<Steps>
  ### ✅ Phase One of Plugins

  Implementing the separation of plugins from the main body, splitting the plugins into independent repositories for maintenance, and implementing dynamic loading of plugins. [**#73**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/73)

  ### ✅ Phase Two of Plugins

  The security and stability of plugin usage, more accurate presentation of abnormal states, maintainability and developer-friendliness of the plugin architecture. [**#97**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/97)

  ### ✅ Phase Three of Plugins

  Higher-level and improved customization capabilities, support for OpenAPI schema invocation, compatibility with ChatGPT plugins, and the addition of Midjourney plugins. [**#411**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/discussions/#411)

  ### 💭 Phase Four of Plugins

  Comprehensive authentication, visual configuration of plugin definitions, Plugin SDK CLI, Python language development template, any other ideas? Join the discussion: [**#1310**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/discussions/#1310)
