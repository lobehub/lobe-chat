By utilizing plugins, LobeChat assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

### Roadmap Progress

The plugin system of LobeChat has now entered a stable stage, and we have basically completed most of the functionality required by the plugin system. However, we are still planning and considering the new possibilities that plugins can bring to us. You can learn more in the following Issues:

<Steps>

### ✅ Phase One of Plugins

Implementing the separation of plugins from the main body, splitting the plugins into independent repositories for maintenance, and implementing dynamic loading of plugins. [**#73**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/73)

### ✅ Phase Two of Plugins

The security and stability of plugin usage, more accurate presentation of abnormal states, maintainability and developer-friendliness of the plugin architecture. [**#97**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/97)

### ✅ Phase Three of Plugins

Higher-level and improved customization capabilities, support for OpenAPI schema invocation, compatibility with ChatGPT plugins, and the addition of Midjourney plugins. [**#411**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/discussions/#411)

### 💭 Phase Four of Plugins

Comprehensive authentication, visual configuration of plugin definitions, Plugin SDK CLI, Python language development template, any other ideas? Join the discussion: [**#1310**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/discussions/#1310)
