In modern applications, user management and identity verification are essential functions. To meet the diverse needs of different users, LobeChat provides two main user authentication and management solutions: `next-auth` and `Clerk`. Whether you are looking for simple user registration and login or need advanced multi-factor authentication and user management, LobeChat can flexibly accommodate your requirements.

## next-auth: Flexible and Powerful Identity Verification Library

LobeChat integrates `next-auth`, a flexible and powerful identity verification library that supports various authentication methods, including OAuth, email login, and credential login. With `next-auth`, you can easily achieve the following functions:

- **User Registration and Login**: Support various authentication methods to meet different user needs.
- **Session Management**: Efficiently manage user sessions to ensure security.
- **Social Login**: Support quick login via various social platforms.
- **Data Security**: Ensure the security and privacy of user data.

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Due to workload constraints, integration of next-auth with a server-side database has not been
  implemented yet. If you need to use a server-side database, please use Clerk.

- **User Profile Management**: Conveniently manage user information and configurations.
- **Login Activity Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of user login activities to ensure account security.
- **Scalability**: Supports complex user management requirements.
