[Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen1.5) is a large language model (LLM) open-sourced by Alibaba Cloud. It is officially defined as a constantly evolving AI large model, and it achieves more accurate Chinese recognition capabilities through more training set content.

<Steps>
  ## Local Installation of Ollama

  First, you need to install Ollama. For the installation process, please refer to the [Ollama Usage Document](/en/usage/providers/ollama).

  ## Pull the Qwen Model to Local with Ollama

  After installing Ollama, you can install the Qwen model with the following command, taking the 14b model as an example:

  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen:14b
