[Featherless](https://featherless.ai/) is a serverless AI inference platform. Our goal is to make all AI models available for serverless inference and we’ve started with large language models (e.g. Qwen, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, RWKV). We provide inference via API to a continually expanding library of open-weight models, including the most popular models for role-playing, creative writing, coding assistance, and more.
