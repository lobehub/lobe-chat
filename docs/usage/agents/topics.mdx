- **Save Topic:** During a conversation, if you want to save the current context and start a new topic, you can click the save button next to the send button.
- **Topic List:** Clicking on a topic in the list allows for quick switching of historical conversation records and continuing the conversation. You can also use the star icon <kbd>⭐️</kbd> to pin favorite topics to the top, or use the more button on the right to rename or delete topics.
