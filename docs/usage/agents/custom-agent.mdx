# Custom Assistant Guide

As the basic functional unit of LobeChat, adding and iterating assistants is very important. Now you can add assistants to your favorites list in two ways.

## `A` Add through the role market

If you are a beginner in Prompt writing, you might want to browse the assistant market of LobeChat first. Here, you can find commonly used assistants submitted by others and easily add them to your list with just one click, which is very convenient.
