[ShareGPT](https://sharegpt.com/) is an AI conversation sharing platform that allows users to easily share their conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can generate a permanent link with just one click, making it convenient to share these conversations with friends or others. By integrating ShareGPT functionality, LobeChat can generate links for conversation records with just one click, making sharing easy.
