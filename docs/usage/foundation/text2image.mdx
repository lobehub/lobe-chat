# Guide to Using Text-to-Image Models in LobeChat

LobeChat supports text-to-image generation through a plugin mechanism. Currently, LobeChat comes with the built-in DALL-E plugin, which allows users to generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E model. Additionally, users can also install the official Midjourney plugin to utilize the Midjourney text-to-image feature.

## DALL-E Model

If you have configured the OpenAI API, you can enable the DALL-E plugin directly in the assistant interface and input prompts in the conversation for AI to generate images for you.

If the DALL-E plugin is not available, please check if the OpenAI API key has been correctly configured.

## Midjourney Model

LobeChat also offers the Midjourney plugin, which generates images by calling the Midjourney API. Please install the Midjourney plugin in the plugin store beforehand.

When using the Midjourney plugin for the first time, you will need to fill in your Midjourney API key in the plugin settings.
