1. **Model Selection**: Choose the Large Language Model (LLM) to be used in the current conversation. For model settings, refer to [Model Providers](https://lobehub.com/docs/usage/providers).
2. **File/Image Upload**: When the selected model supports file or image recognition, users can upload files or images during the conversation with the model.
3. **Temperature Setting**: Adjust the randomness level of the model's output. The higher the value, the more random the output results. For detailed information, refer to the [Large Language Model Guide](https://lobehub.com/docs/usage/agents/model).
4. **History Record Setting**: Set the number of chat records the model needs to remember in this conversation. The longer the history, the more conversation content the model can remember, but it will also consume more context tokens.
5. **Voice Input**: Click this button to convert speech to text input. For more information, refer to [Speech-to-Text Conversion](https://lobehub.com/docs/usage/foundation/tts-stt).
6. **Plugin Setting**: Choose the plugins to enable in this conversation. For more information, refer to [Plugin Usage](https://lobehub.com/docs/usage/plugins/basic-usage).
7. **Token Usage**: Display the context length and token consumption of this conversation.
8. **Start New Topic**: End the current conversation and start a new topic. For more information, refer to [Topic Usage](https://lobehub.com/docs/usage/agents/topics).
