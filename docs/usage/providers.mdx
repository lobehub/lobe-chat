In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model providers for providing AI conversation services to meet the needs of the community. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model providers instead of being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversation options.

This approach allows LobeChat to adapt more flexibly to different user needs and provides developers with a wider range of choices.
