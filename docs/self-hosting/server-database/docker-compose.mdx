<Callout type="info">
  This article assumes you are familiar with the basic principles and processes of deploying the
  LobeChat server database version (hereinafter referred to as DB version), so it only includes core
  environment variable configurations. If you are not familiar with the deployment principles of
  LobeChat DB version, please refer to [Deploying with a Server
  Database](/docs/self-hosting/server-database).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Due to the inability to expose `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` using Docker environment variables, you cannot use Clerk as a login authentication service when deploying LobeChat with Docker / Docker Compose.

If you need Clerk as a login authentication service, consider deploying with Vercel or building your own image.

</Callout>

In general, to fully run the LobeChat database version, you need at least the following four services:

- The LobeChat database version itself
- A PostgreSQL database with the PGVector plugin
- An object storage service that supports S3 protocol
- An SSO login authentication service supported by LobeChat

These services can be combined through self-built or online cloud services to meet different levels of deployment needs.

In this article, we provide a Docker Compose configuration entirely based on open-source self-built services. You can use this configuration file directly to start the LobeChat database version or modify it to suit your needs.

We default to using [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) as the local S3 object storage service and [Casdoor](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor) as the local authentication service.

## Quick Start

To facilitate a quick start, this section uses the `docker-compose/local` directory's `docker-compose.yml` configuration file. The started LobeChat application runs at `http://localhost:3210` and can be run locally.

<Callout type="warning">
  For a quick start, this `docker-compose.yml` contains a large number of sensitive Secret/Password
  fields, suitable only for quick demonstrations or personal local use. Do not use it directly in a
  production environment! Otherwise, you will be responsible for any security issues encountered!
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### One-click Startup Script

Create a new directory named `lobe-chat-db` to store your configuration files and subsequent database files.

```sh
mkdir lobe-chat-db
cd lobe-chat-db
```

We provide a one-click startup script `setup.sh`, which can automatically use the default configuration and start the service:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/HEAD/docker-compose/local/setup.sh) -f
```

### Start Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The default login account is the default account of Casdoor, with the username `admin`. You can find the password in the `init_data.json` file that is downloaded during setup. Note that the secret might fail to generate, please check the shell output.

### Check Logs

```sh
docker logs -f lobe-chat
```

If you see the following logs in the container, it means the startup was successful:

```log
[Database] Start to migration...
✅ database migration pass.
-------------------------------------
  ▲ Next.js 14.x.x
  - Local:        http://localhost:3210
  - Network:      http://0.0.0.0:3210

 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 95ms
```

</Steps>

At this point, you have successfully deployed the LobeChat database version, and you can access your LobeChat service at `http://localhost:3210`.

If you encounter problems, try checking the Docker logs and console logs for troubleshooting.

## Publishing to Production (IP Mode)

The following assumes that the machine IP running the LobeChat service on the LAN/public network is `your_server_ip`.

To access via the local network IP, you first need to run the local startup:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/HEAD/docker-compose/local/setup.sh) -f
docker compose up -d
```

Next, you need to modify the downloaded `docker-compose.yml` file, performing a global replacement to change `localhost` to `your_server_ip`, and then restart:

```sh
sed -i 's/localhost/your_server_ip/g' docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

### Configuring Casdoor

1. After starting with the `setup.sh` script, the default port for Casdoor WebUI is `8000`. You can access it via `http://your_server_ip:8000`, with the default username `admin`. The password can be found in the `init_data.json` file that is downloaded during setup. Note that the secret might fail to generate, please check the shell output.

2. In `Identity -> Applications`, add a new line:

   ```
   http://your_server_ip:3210/api/auth/callback/casdoor
   ```

3. Most other configurations can remain default; you can modify the default configurations in `Identity -> Applications`.

### Configuring MinIO S3

1. After starting with the `setup.sh` script, the default port for MinIO WebUI is `9001`. You can access it via `http://your_server_ip:9001`, with the default username `YOUR_MINIO_USER` and password `YOUR_MINIO_PASSWORD`.

2. Most configurations can remain default. If you wish to allow users to change their avatars, you need to create a bucket named `casdoor` in `buckets`, select custom policy, and copy and paste the following content (if you have changed the bucket name, please find and replace):

   ```json
   {
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": ["*"]
         },
         "Action": ["s3:GetBucketLocation"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::casdoor"]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": ["*"]
         },
         "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::casdoor"],
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "s3:prefix": ["files/*"]
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": ["*"]
         },
         "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject", "s3:GetObject"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::casdoor/**"]
       }
     ],
     "Version": "2012-10-17"
   }
   ```

3. Create a new access key and store the generated `Access Key` and `Secret Key`.

4. In Casdoor's `Identity -> Providers`, associate the MinIO S3 service. Here is a sample configuration:

   ![casdoor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71035610-0706-434e-9488-ab5819b55330)

   The Client ID and Client Secret should be the `Access Key` and `Secret Key` from the previous step, and `192.168.31.251` should be replaced with `your_server_ip`.

5. In Casdoor's `Identity -> Applications`, add the provider to the `app-built-in` application, select `minio`, save and exit.

6. You can try uploading a file in Casdoor's `Identity -> Resources` to test if the configuration is correct.

## Publishing to Production (Domain Name Mode)

<Callout type="info">
  For deployments with a domain name, we recommend using [Logto](https://logto.io/) as the login
  authentication service. The remainder of this article will use it as an example. If you use other
  authentication services like Casdoor, the process should be similar, but note that different
  authentication services may have different port configurations.
</Callout>

In the following text, we assume that in addition to the above services, you are also running a layer of Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL configuration.

The domain and associated service port descriptions are as follows:

- `lobe.example.com`: Your LobeChat service domain, which needs to reverse proxy to the LobeChat service port, defaulting to `3210`.
- `lobe-auth-api.example.com`: Your Logto service domain, which needs to reverse proxy to the Logto API service port, defaulting to `3001`.
- `lobe-auth-ui.example.com`: Your Logto UI domain, which needs to reverse proxy to the Logto WebUI service port, defaulting to `3002`.
- `lobe-s3-api.example.com`: Your MinIO API domain, which needs to reverse proxy to the MinIO API service port, defaulting to `9000`.
- `lobe-s3-ui.example.com`: Optional, your MinIO UI domain, which needs to reverse proxy to the MinIO WebUI service port, defaulting to `9001`.

And the service ports that do not require reverse proxy:

- `postgresql`: Your PostgreSQL database service port, defaulting to `5432`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that CORS cross-domain is configured internally in MinIO / Logto services. Do not configure CORS additionally in your reverse proxy, as this will cause errors.

For MinIO not on port 443, the Host must be `$http_host` (with port number), otherwise a 403 error will occur: `proxy_set_header Host $http_host`.

If you need to configure an SSL certificate, please configure it uniformly in the outer Nginx reverse proxy and not in MinIO.

</Callout>

### Configuration Files

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/HEAD/docker-compose/production/logto/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/HEAD/docker-compose/production/logto/.env.example > .env
```

The configuration files include both `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`, where the `.env` file is used to configure the environment variables for LobeChat, and the `docker-compose.yml` file is used to configure the Postgres, MinIO, and Logto services.

Generally, you should only modify sensitive information such as domain names and account passwords, while keeping other configuration items at their default values.

Refer to the appendix for example configurations.

### Postgres Database Configuration

You can check the logs with the following command:

```sh
docker logs -f lobe-chat
```

<Callout type="tip">
  In our official Docker image, database schema migration is automatically executed before starting
  the image. Our official image promises stability in the automatic creation of tables from "empty
  database -> complete tables." Therefore, we recommend that your database instance use an empty
  table instance to avoid the hassle of manual table structure maintenance or migration.
</Callout>

If you encounter issues when creating tables, you can try the following command to force remove the database container and restart:

```sh
docker compose down  # Stop the service
sudo rm -rf ./data   # Remove mounted database data
docker compose up -d # Restart
```

### Login Authentication Service Configuration

This article uses Logto as an example to explain the configuration process. If you are using other authentication service providers, please refer to their documentation for configuration.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please remember to configure the CORS cross-domain settings for the corresponding login authentication service provider to ensure LobeChat can access the authentication service properly.

In this article, you need to allow cross-domain requests from `https://lobe.example.com`.

</Callout>

You first need to visit the WebUI for configuration:

- If you have configured the reverse proxy as mentioned earlier, open `https://lobe-auth-ui.example.com`.
- Otherwise, open `http://localhost:3002` after performing port mapping.

1. Register a new account; the first registered account will automatically become an administrator.

2. In `Applications`, create a `Next.js (App Router)` application with any name.

3. Set `Redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/api/auth/callback/logto`, and `Post sign-out redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/`.

4. Set `CORS allowed origins` to `https://lobe.example.com`.

     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b816379-c07b-40ea-bde4-df16e2e4e523"
   />

5. Obtain `App ID` and `App secrets`, and fill them into your `.env` file under `AUTH_LOGTO_ID` and `AUTH_LOGTO_SECRET`.

6. Set `AUTH_LOGTO_ISSUER` in your `.env` file to `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com/oidc`.

     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15af6d94-af4f-4aa9-bbab-7a46e9f9e837"
   />

7. Optionally, in the left panel under `Sign-in experience`, you can disable `Enable user registration` in `Sign-up and sign-in - Advanced Options` to prevent users from registering on their own. If you disable user registration, you will need to manually add users in the left panel under `User Management`.

   <Image
     alt="Disable User Registration"
     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b2e6f7b-fec5-41c6-864a-a1add40f74a0"
   />

8. Restart the LobeChat service:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that the administrator account is not the same as a registered user. Do not log in to
  LobeChat with your administrator account, as this will only result in an error.
</Callout>

### S3 Object Storage Service Configuration

This article uses MinIO as an example to explain the configuration process. If you are using other S3 service providers, please refer to their documentation for configuration.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please remember to configure the CORS cross-domain settings for the corresponding S3 service provider to ensure LobeChat can access the S3 service properly.

In this article, you need to allow cross-domain requests from `https://lobe.example.com`. This can be configured in MinIO WebUI under `Configuration - API - Cors Allow Origin`, or in the Docker Compose under `minio - environment - MINIO_API_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN`.

If you use the second method (which is also the default method) for configuration, you will not be able to configure it in MinIO WebUI anymore.

</Callout>

You first need to visit the WebUI for configuration:

- If you have configured the reverse proxy as mentioned earlier, open `https://lobe-s3-ui.example.com`.
- Otherwise, open `http://localhost:9001` after performing port mapping.

1. Enter your set `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` on the login page, then click login.

2. In the left panel under Administer / Buckets, click `Create Bucket`, enter `lobe` (which corresponds to your `S3_BUCKET` environment variable), and then click `Create`.

   <Image
     alt="Create MinIO Bucket"
     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79f44a13-00d3-4302-a6bc-5f4c6cdbffab"
   />

3. Select your bucket, click Summary - Access Policy, edit, choose `Custom`, input the content from `minio-bucket-config.json` (see appendix), and save (assuming your bucket name is `lobe`):

   <Image
     alt="Select MinIO Bucket Policy"
     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57032a82-7604-45d3-ba12-884af6fbcb7c"
   />

   <Image
     alt="Configure MinIO Bucket Policy"
     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8109f4e-71fc-4ba8-8402-ede92669d5e0"
   />

4. In the left panel under User / Access Keys, click `Create New Access Key`, without any extra modifications, and fill the generated `Access Key` and `Secret Key` into your `.env` file under `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

   <Image
     alt="Create MinIO Access Key"
     src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72f02ce5-9991-425b-9864-9113ee1ed6bf"
   />

5. Restart the LobeChat service:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

At this point, you have successfully deployed the LobeChat database version, and you can access your LobeChat service at `https://lobe.example.com`.

## Appendix
