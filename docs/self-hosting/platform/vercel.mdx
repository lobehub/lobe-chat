# Deploy LobeChat with Vercel

If you want to deploy LobeChat on Vercel, you can follow the steps below:

## Vercel Deployment Process

<Steps>
  ### Prepare your OpenAI API Key

  Go to [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to get your OpenAI API Key.

  ### Click the button below to deploy

  [![][deploy-button-image]][deploy-link]

  Simply log in with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) in the environment variables page.

  ### After deployment, you can start using it

  ### Bind a custom domain (optional)

  Vercel's assigned domain DNS may be polluted in some regions, so binding a custom domain can establish a direct connection.
</Steps>

## Automatic Synchronization of Updates

If you have deployed your project using the one-click deployment steps mentioned above, you may find that you are always prompted with "updates available." This is because Vercel creates a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, which causes the inability to accurately detect updates.

  We recommend following the [Self-Hosting Upstream Sync](/zh/self-hosting/upstream-sync) steps to
  Redeploy.
