# Data Analysis

To better help analyze the usage of LobeChat users, we have integrated several free/open-source data analytics services in LobeChat for collecting user usage data, which you can enable as needed.

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Currently, the integrated data analytics platforms only support deployment and usage on
  Vercel/Zeit platforms and do not support Docker/Docker Compose deployment.

## Vercel Analytics

[Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) is a data analytics service launched by Vercel, which can help you collect website visit data, including traffic, sources, and devices used for access.

We have integrated Vercel Analytics into the code, and you can enable it by setting the environment variable `ENABLE_VERCEL_ANALYTICS=1`, and then open the Analytics tab in your Vercel deployment project to view your app's visit data.

Vercel Analytics provides 2500 free Web Analytics Events per month (which can be understood as page views), which is generally sufficient for personal deployment and self-use products.

If you need to learn more about using Vercel Analytics, please refer to the [Vercel Web Analytics Quick Start](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart).
