# Upstream Sync

## `A` Vercel / Zeabur Deployment

If you deployed your project according to the one-click deployment steps in the README, you may have noticed that you are always prompted with "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project for you instead of forking the original project, which prevents accurate update detection. We recommend following these steps to redeploy:

- Delete the original repository;
- Use the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button in the top right corner of the page to fork the original project;
- Redeploy on `Vercel`.

### Enable Automatic Updates

<Callout>
  If you encounter an error when executing `Upstream Sync`, please try executing it manually again
</Callout>

After forking the project, due to Github's limitations, you need to manually enable Workflows on the Actions page of your forked project and start the Upstream Sync Action. Once enabled, you can set up automatic updates to occur every hour.

If you encounter a sync failure, you need to manually click "Update Branch" once.

## `B` Docker Deployment

Upgrading the Docker deployment version is very simple, you just need to redeploy the latest LobeChat image. Here are the commands required to perform these steps:

<Steps>
  ### Stop and Remove the Current Running LobeChat Container

  Assuming the LobeChat container is named `lobe-chat`, use the following commands to stop and remove the currently running LobeChat container:

  ```fish
  docker stop lobe-chat
  docker rm lobe-chat
  ```

  ### Pull the Latest LobeChat Image

  Use the following command to pull the latest Docker image for LobeChat:

  ```fish
  docker pull lobehub/lobe-chat
  ```

  ### Restart the Docker Container

  Redeploy the LobeChat container using the newly pulled image:

  ```fish
  docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
    -e OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1 \
    -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
    --name lobe-chat \
    lobehub/lobe-chat
  ```
</Steps>

Ensure that you have sufficient permissions to stop and remove the container before executing these commands, and that Docker has sufficient permissions to pull the new image.

<Callout type={'tip'}>
  **If I redeploy, will I lose my local chat records?**

  No need to worry, you won't. All of LobeChat's chat records are stored in your local browser. Therefore, when redeploying LobeChat using Docker, your chat records will not be lost.
</Callout>

If you wish to automate the above steps, you can follow the method below and use Crontab scheduling to complete it. The specific steps are as follows.

<Steps>
  ### Write automatic update scripts and configuration files

  First, create a `lobe.env` configuration file with various environment variables, for example:

  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
  OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1
  ACCESS_CODE=arthals2333
  OPENAI_MODEL_LIST=-gpt-4,-gpt-4-32k,-gpt-3.5-turbo-16k,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k,gpt-4-0125-preview=gpt-4-turbo,gpt-4-vision-preview=gpt-4-vision
  ```

  Then, you can use the following script to automate the update:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # auto-update-lobe-chat.sh

  # Set up proxy (optional)
  export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:7890

  # Pull the latest image and store the output in a variable
  output=$(docker pull lobehub/lobe-chat:latest 2>&1)

  # Check if the pull command was executed successfully
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
  fi

  # Check if the output contains a specific string
  echo "$output" | grep -q "Image is up to date for lobehub/lobe-chat:latest"

  # If the image is already up to date, do nothing
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    exit 0
  fi

  echo "Detected lobe-chat update"

  # Remove the old container
  echo "Removed: $(docker rm -f lobe-chat)"

  # Run the new container(Please change the path to the env file)
  echo "Started: $(docker run -d --network=host --env-file /path/to/lobe.env --name=lobe-chat --restart=always lobehub/lobe-chat)"

  # Print the update time and version
  echo "Update time: $(date)"
  echo "Version: $(docker inspect lobehub/lobe-chat:latest | grep 'org.opencontainers.image.version' | awk -F'"' '{print $4}')"

  # Clean up unused images
  docker images | grep 'lobehub/lobe-chat' | grep -v 'lobehub/lobe-chat-database' | grep -v 'latest' | awk '{print $3}' | xargs -r docker rmi > /dev/null 2>&1
  echo "Removed old images."
  ```

  <Callout type={'warning'}>
    This script can be used in Crontab, but please ensure that your Crontab can find the correct
    Docker command. It is recommended to use absolute paths.
  </Callout>

  Configure Crontab to execute the script every 5 minutes:

  ### Configure Crontab to automatically execute scripts

  The following command configures Crontab to execute scripts every 5 minutes, or as often as you like:

  ```bash
  */5 * * * * /path/to/auto-update-lobe-chat.sh >> /path/to/auto-update-lobe-chat.log 2>&1
  ```
</Steps>
