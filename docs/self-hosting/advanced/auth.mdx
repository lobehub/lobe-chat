# Authentication Service

LobeChat supports the configuration of external authentication services using Clerk or Next Auth for internal use within enterprises/organizations to centrally manage user authorization.

## Clerk

Clerk is a comprehensive identity verification solution that has recently gained popularity. It provides a simple yet powerful API and services to handle user authentication and session management. Clerk's design philosophy is to offer a concise and modern authentication solution that enables developers to easily integrate and use it.

LobeChat has deeply integrated with Clerk to provide users with a more secure and convenient login and registration experience. It also relieves developers from the burden of managing authentication logic. Clerk's concise and modern design philosophy aligns perfectly with LobeChat's goals, making user management on the entire platform more efficient and reliable.

By setting the environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in LobeChat's environment, you can enable and use Clerk.

## Next Auth

Before using NextAuth, please set the following variables in LobeChat's environment variables:

| Environment Variable           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEXT_AUTH` | Required | This is used to enable the NextAuth service. Set it to `1` to enable it; changing this setting requires recompiling the application. Users deploying with the `lobehub/lobe-chat-database` image have this configuration added by default. |
| `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET`             | Required | The key used to encrypt Auth.js session tokens. You can use the following command: `openssl rand -base64 32`, or visit `https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32` to generate the key.                                                        |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`                 | Required | This URL specifies the callback address for Auth.js when performing OAuth verification. Set this only if the default generated redirect address is incorrect. `https://example.com/api/auth`                                               |
| `NEXT_AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS`      | Optional | This environment variable is used to enable multiple identity verification sources simultaneously, separated by commas, for example, `auth0,microsoft-entra-id,authentik`.                                                                 |
