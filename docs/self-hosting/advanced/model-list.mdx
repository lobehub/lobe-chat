# Model List

LobeChat supports customizing the model list during deployment. You can use `+` to add a model, `-` to hide a model, and use `model name=display name<extension configuration>` to customize the display name of a model, separated by English commas. The basic syntax is as follows:

```shell
id=displayName < maxToken:vision:fc:file > ,model2,model3
```

For example: `+qwen-7b-chat,+glm-6b,-gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-4-0125-preview=gpt-4-turbo`

In the above example, it adds `qwen-7b-chat` and `glm-6b` to the model list, removes `gpt-3.5-turbo` from the list, and displays the model name of `gpt-4-0125-preview` as `gpt-4-turbo`. If you want to disable all models first and then enable specific models, you can use `-all,+gpt-3.5-turbo`, which means only enabling `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

## Extension Capabilities

Considering the diversity of model capabilities, we started to add extension configuration in version `0.147.8`, with the following rules:

```shell
id=displayName<maxToken:vision:fc:file>
```

The first value in angle brackets is designated as the `maxToken` for this model. The second value and beyond are the model's extension capabilities, separated by colons `:`, and the order is not important.

Examples are as follows:

- `chatglm-6b=ChatGLM 6B<4096>`: ChatGLM 6B, maximum context of 4k, no advanced capabilities;
- `spark-v3.5=讯飞星火 v3.5<8192:fc>`: Xunfei Spark 3.5 model, maximum context of 8k, supports Function Call;
- `gemini-pro-vision=Gemini Pro Vision<16000:vision>`: Google Vision model, maximum context of 16k, supports image recognition;
- `gpt-4-all=ChatGPT Plus<128000:fc:vision:file>`, hacked version of ChatGPT Plus web, context of 128k, supports image recognition, Function Call, file upload.

Currently supported extension capabilities are:

| ---      | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fc`     | Function Calling                                         |
| `vision` | Image Recognition                                        |
| `file`   | File Upload (a bit hacky, not recommended for daily use) |
