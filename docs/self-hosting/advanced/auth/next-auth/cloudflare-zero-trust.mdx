# Configuring Cloudflare Zero Trust Authentication Service

## Cloudflare Zero Trust Configuration Flow

<Steps>
  ### Creating an Application in Cloudflare Zero Trust

  We assume you are already familiar with using the Cloudflare Zero Trust platform and that your LobeChat instance is deployed at `https://chat.example.com`.

  First, we need to visit `https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/` and navigate to `Access - Applications`.

  Now, on the current page, click `Add an application` and select `SaaS`.

  In the `Application` text box, enter the application name, such as `LobeChat SSO`. Then click `Select OIDC`, followed by clicking `Add application`.

  At this point, you have successfully created a SaaS application named `LobeChat SSO` in Cloudflare Zero Trust.

  Next, we need to enter `https://chat.example.com/api/auth/callback/cloudflare-zero-trust` in the `Redirect URLs` field (note that `chat.example.com` should be replaced with your instance's address).

  Finally, scroll down the page and record the following three values: `Client secret`, `Client ID`, and `Issuer`. You will need these for setting the environment variables when deploying LobeChat.

  ### Configure Environment Variables

  When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:
