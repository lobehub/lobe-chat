# Configuring Keycloak Authentication Service in LobeChat

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides single sign-on, identity brokering, and social login features, suitable for modern applications and services.

<Callout type={'tip'}>
  If you want to privately deploy Keycloak, we recommend using it together with LobeChat via Docker Compose deployment for easier service management.
</Callout>

## Keycloak Configuration Process

If you deploy using a local network IP, this guide assumes:

- Your LobeChat database version IP/port is `http://LOBECHAT_IP:3210`.
- Your privately deployed Keycloak domain is `http://KEYCLOAK_IP:8080`.

If you deploy using a public network, this guide assumes:

- Your LobeChat database version domain is `https://lobe.example.com`.
- Your privately deployed Keycloak domain is `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com`.

<Steps>
  ### Create Keycloak Realm and Client

  Access your privately deployed Keycloak admin console (default is `http://localhost:8080/admin`) and log in with the administrator account.

  1. Create a new Realm
     - Click the dropdown menu in the upper left corner and select "Create Realm"
     - Enter a name, such as "LobeChat", then click "Create"

  2. Create a Client
     - Select "Clients" from the left menu, then click "Create client"
     - Fill in the following information:
       - Client ID: `lobechat`
       - Client type: `OpenID Connect`
       - Click "Next"
     - On the "Capability config" page:
       - Enable "Client authentication"
       - Enable "Standard flow"
       - Click "Next"
     - On the "Login settings" page:
       - Valid redirect URIs:
         - Local development environment: `http://localhost:3210/api/auth/callback/keycloak`
         - Local network IP deployment: `http://LOBECHAT_IP:3210/api/auth/callback/keycloak`
         - Public environment: `https://lobe.example.com/api/auth/callback/keycloak`
       - Web origins: Add your LobeChat domain or IP
       - Click "Save"

  3. Get Client Secret
     - On the client details page, switch to the "Credentials" tab
     - Copy the "Client secret" value, which will be needed later

  ### Configure Users and Roles (Optional)

  1. Create Users
     - Select "Users" from the left menu, then click "Add user"
     - Fill in the user information and click "Create"
     - On the user details page, switch to the "Credentials" tab
     - Set a password, and disable the "Temporary" option if needed
     - Click "Set Password" to save

  2. Create Roles and Permissions
     - Select "Realm roles" from the left menu
     - Click "Create role"
     - Create necessary roles, such as "admin", "user", etc.
     - Assign roles to users: On the user details page, switch to the "Role mapping" tab and assign appropriate roles

  ### Disable Registration (Optional)

  To ensure the security of your application, it's recommended to control Keycloak's registration functionality.

  1. Select "Realm settings" from the left menu
  2. Switch to the "Login" tab
  3. In the "User registration" section, disable the "User registration" option
  4. Click "Save" to save the settings

  <Callout type={'warning'}>
    If registration is not disabled, anyone might be able to register and log in to your application. Please configure according to your security requirements.
  </Callout>

  ### Configure Environment Variables

  Set the obtained client ID and client secret as `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ID` and `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET` in the LobeChat environment variables.

  Configure the LobeChat environment variable `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` as:

  - `http://localhost:8080/realms/LobeChat` for local development environment
  - `http://KEYCLOAK_IP:8080/realms/LobeChat` for privately deployed Keycloak on a local network
  - `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com/realms/LobeChat` for Keycloak deployed in a public environment

  When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:
