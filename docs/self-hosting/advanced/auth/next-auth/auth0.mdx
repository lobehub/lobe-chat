http(s)://your-domain/api/auth/callback/auth0
```

  consistent with the deployed URL.

Click on the "Users Management" in the left navigation bar to enter the user management interface, where you can create users for your organization to log in to LobeChat.

### Configure Environment Variables

When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET` | Required | Key used to encrypt Auth.js session tokens. You can generate a key using the following command: `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXT_AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS` | Required | Select the single sign-on provider for LoboChat. Use `auth0` for Auth0. |
| `AUTH_AUTH0_ID` | Required | Client ID of the Auth0 application |
| `AUTH_AUTH0_SECRET` | Required | Client Secret of the Auth0 application |
| `AUTH_AUTH0_ISSUER` | Required | Domain of the Auth0 application, `https://example.auth0.com` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Required | The URL is used to specify the callback address for the execution of OAuth authentication in Auth.js. It needs to be set only when the default address is incorrect. `https://example.com/api/auth` |

  <Callout type={'tip'}>
    You can refer to the related variable details at [📘Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/environment-variable#auth0).

</Callout>
</Steps>

<Callout>
  After successful deployment, users will be able to authenticate and use LobeChat using the users
  configured in Auth0.
</Callout>

## Advanced Configuration

### Connecting to an Existing Single Sign-On Service

If your enterprise or organization already has a unified identity authentication infrastructure, you can connect to an existing single sign-on service in Applications -> SSO Integrations.

Auth0 supports single sign-on services such as Azure Active Directory, Slack, Google Workspace, Office 365, Zoom, and more. For a detailed list of supported services, please refer to [this link][auth0-sso-integrations].

/>

### Configuring Social Login

If your enterprise or organization needs to support external user logins, you can configure social login services in Authentication -> Social.

/>

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Configuring social login services by default allows anyone to authenticate, which may lead to
  LobeChat being abused by external users.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  If you need to restrict login users, be sure to configure a **blocking policy**: After enabling
  the social login option, refer to [this article][auth0-login-actions-manual] to create an Action
  to set up a blocking/allow list.
