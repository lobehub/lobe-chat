# Configuring Logto Authentication Service

[Logto](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) is an open-source authentication service with a simple and beautiful interface, rich in features and easy to use. You can choose to use the official Logto Cloud or opt for a private deployment of Logto.

<Callout type={'tip'}>
  If you want to deploy Logto privately, we recommend using Docker Compose to deploy it together
  with the LobeChat database version. In this case, LobeChat can share the same Postgres instance
  with it.
</Callout>

## Logto Configuration Process

The following assumes your LobeChat database version domain is `https://lobe.example.com`.

If you are using a privately deployed Logto, assume its endpoint domain is `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com`.

If you are using Logto Cloud, assume its endpoint domain is `https://example.logto.app`.

<Steps>
  ### Create Logto Application

  Access your privately deployed Logto WebUI or [Logto Cloud](http://cloud.logto.io/) to enter the console, and create a `Next.js (App Router)` application under `Applications` with any name.

  ### Configure Logto

  Set the `Redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/api/auth/callback/logto` and the `Post sign-out redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/`.

  Set `CORS allowed origins` to `https://lobe.example.com`.

  After successful creation, save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

  ### Configure Environment Variables

  <Image alt="Configure Environment Variables" inStep src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15af6d94-af4f-4aa9-bbab-7a46e9f9e837" />

  Set the obtained `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as `AUTH_LOGTO_ID` and `AUTH_LOGTO_SECRET` in the LobeChat environment variables.

  Configure `AUTH_LOGTO_ISSUER` in the LobeChat environment variables as follows:

  - `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com/oidc` if you are using a privately deployed Logto
  - `https://example.logto.app/oidc` if you are using Logto Cloud

  When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:

  | Environment Variable      | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

  | `AUTH_LOGTO_ISSUER`       | Required | OpenID Connect issuer of the Logto provider                                                                                                                                            |
