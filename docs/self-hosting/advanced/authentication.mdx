# LobeChat Authorization

LobeChat supports the configuration of external identity verification services for internal use within enterprises/organizations to centrally manage user authorization.

## Clerk

Clerk is a comprehensive identity verification solution that has recently gained popularity. It provides a simple yet powerful API and services to handle user authentication and session management. Clerk's design philosophy is to offer a concise and modern authentication solution that enables developers to easily integrate and use it.

LobeChat has deeply integrated with Clerk to provide users with a more secure and convenient login and registration experience. It also relieves developers from the burden of managing authentication logic. Clerk's concise and modern design philosophy aligns perfectly with LobeChat's goals, making user management on the entire platform more efficient and reliable.

By setting the environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY in LobeChat's environment, you can enable and use Clerk.

## Advanced Configuration

To simultaneously enable multiple identity verification sources, please set the `NEXT_AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable, separating them with commas, for example, `auth0,azure-ad,authentik`.

The order corresponds to the display order of the SSO providers.

| SSO Provider       | Value       |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Auth0              | `auth0`     |
