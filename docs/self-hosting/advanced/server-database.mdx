# Deploying Server-Side Database

LobeChat defaults to using a client-side database (IndexedDB) but also supports using a server-side database. LobeChat uses Postgres as the backend storage database. PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system with high scalability and standard SQL support. It provides rich data types, concurrency control, data integrity, security, and programmability, making it suitable for complex applications and large-scale data management.

This article will detail how to deploy the server-side database version of LobeChat on Vercel, including: 1) database configuration; 2) identity authentication service configuration; 3) steps for setting up the S3 storage service.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  Due to workload constraints, currently only deployment on Vercel using the server-side database
  version is supported, with Docker version support planned for future iterations.
</Callout>

<Callout type={'warning'}>Before deploying the server, please export your backup!</Callout>

## 1. Configure the Database

<Steps>

### Prepare a Server-Side Database Instance and Obtain the Connection URL

Before deployment, make sure you have prepared a Postgres database instance. You can choose either of the following methods:

- `A.` Use Serverless Postgres instances like Vercel/Neon;
- `B.` Use self-deployed Postgres instances like Docker.

The configuration for both methods is slightly different, which will be distinguished in the next step.

### Add Environment Variables in Vercel

In Vercel's deployment environment variables, add the `DATABASE_URL` and other environment variables. Fill in the prepared Postgres database connection URL. The typical format for the database connection URL is `postgres://username:password@host:port/database`.

<Tabs items={['Serverless Postgres', 'Node Postgres']}>

<Tab>

Variables required for Serverless Postgres are as follows:

```shell
# Serverless Postgres DB Url
DATABASE_URL=

# Specify the service mode as server, otherwise it won't enter the server-side database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_MODE=server
```

An example of how to fill in Vercel is shown below:

<Image
  alt={'Add Serverless Postgres DATABASE_URL'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/d4a710cd-6404-4196-90d0-cd08ca385074'}
></Image>

</Tab>

<Tab>
  Variables required for Node Postgres are as follows:

```shell
# Node Postgres DB Url
DATABASE_URL=

# Specify the Postgres database driver as node
DATABASE_DRIVER=node

# Specify the service mode as server, otherwise it won't enter the server-side database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_MODE=server
```

An example of how to fill in Vercel is shown below:

<Image
  alt={'Add Node Postgres DATABASE_URL'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/1c689738-809b-4199-b305-ba5770d39da7'}
></Image>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Add the `KEY_VAULTS_SECRET` Environment Variable

After adding the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, you need to add a `KEY_VAULTS_SECRET` environment variable. This variable is used to encrypt sensitive information like user-stored API keys. You can generate a random 32-character string as the key using `openssl rand -base64 32`.

```shell
KEY_VAULTS_SECRET=jgwsK28dspyVQoIf8/M3IIHl1h6LYYceSYNXeLpy6uk=
```

Add this to the Vercel environment variables as well.

</Steps>

## 2. Configure the Identity Authentication Service

A server-side database needs to be paired with an identity authentication service to function properly. Therefore, the corresponding identity authentication service needs to be configured.

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Due to workload constraints, currently only Clerk is supported as an identity authentication
  service solution. Integration with Next-Auth for server-side database is under development.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Prepare the Clerk Identity Authentication Service

Go to [Clerk](https://clerk.com?utm_source=lobehub&utm_medium=docs) to register and create an application to obtain the corresponding Public Key and Secret Key.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  If you are unfamiliar with Clerk, you can refer to [Authentication
  Service-Clerk](/en/docs/self-hosting/advanced/authentication#clerk) for details on using Clerk.
</Callout>

### Add Public and Private Key Environment Variables in Vercel

In Vercel's deployment environment variables, add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables. You can click on "API Keys" in the menu, then copy the corresponding values and paste them into Vercel's environment variables.

<Image
  alt={'Find the corresponding public and private key environment variables in Clerk'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/89883703-7a1a-4a11-b944-5d804544e57c'}
></Image>

The environment variables required for this step are as follows:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Add these variables to Vercel:

<Image
  alt={'Add Clerk public and private key environment variables in Vercel'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/2bfa13df-6e20-4768-97c0-4dad06c85a2f'}
></Image>

### Create and Configure a Webhook in Clerk

Since we let Clerk handle user authentication and management entirely, we need Clerk to notify our application and store data in the database when there are changes in the user lifecycle (create, update, delete). We achieve this using the Webhook provided by Clerk.

We need to add an endpoint in Clerk's Webhooks to inform Clerk to send notifications to this endpoint when a user's status changes.

<Image
  alt={'Add an endpoint in Clerk Webhooks'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/f50f47fb-5e8e-4930-bf4e-8cf6f5b8afb9'}
>

</Image>

Fill in your Vercel project's URL in the endpoint, such as `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`. Then, in the Subscribe to events section, check the three user events (`user.created`, `user.deleted`, `user.updated`), and click create.

<Image
  alt={'Configure URL and user events when adding Clerk Webhooks'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/0249ea56-ab17-4aa9-a56c-9ebd556c2645'}
></Image>

### Add the Webhook Secret to Vercel Environment Variables

After creation, you can find the secret of this Webhook in the bottom right corner:

<Image
  alt={'View Clerk Webhook secret'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/fab4abb2-584b-49de-9340-813382951635'}
></Image>

The corresponding environment variable name for this secret is `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:

```shell
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Add this to Vercel's environment variables:

<Image
alt={'Add Clerk Webhook secret in Vercel'}
src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/5fdc9479-007f-46ab-9d6e-a9603e949116'}>

</Image>

</Steps>

You have now successfully configured the Clerk identity authentication service. Next, we will configure the S3 storage service.

## 3. Configure S3 Storage Service

LobeChat has long supported multimodal AI conversations, involving the function of uploading images to AI. In the client-side database solution, image files are stored as binary data in the browser's indexedDB database. However, this solution is not feasible in the server-side database. We need to configure the S3 storage service to store a large number of image files, and S3 can also serve as a storage solution for file uploads.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  In this article, S3 refers to a compatible S3 storage solution, which supports object storage
  systems that comply with the Amazon S3 API. Common examples include Cloudflare R2 etc., all of
  which support S3-compatible APIs.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Configure and Obtain S3 Bucket

You need to go to your S3 service provider (such as AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.) and create a new storage bucket. Below is an example of the creation process using Cloudflare R2.

The interface of Cloudflare R2 is shown below:

<Image
  alt={'Cloudflare R2 Storage Interface'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/41f7f677-0153-4a96-b849-5ac9b7ebefee'}
></Image>

When creating the bucket, specify its name and then click create.

<Image
  alt={'Create Bucket in R2'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/9c0d184c-3169-40fa-9115-011cfffb9ca7'}
></Image>

### Obtain Environment Variables for the Bucket

In the settings of the R2 storage bucket, you can view the bucket configuration information:

<Image
  alt={'View Bucket Information'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/2ceb210c-eca0-4439-ba27-8734d4ebb3ee'}
></Image>

The corresponding environment variables are:

```shell
# Bucket name
S3_BUCKET=lobechat
# Bucket request endpoint
S3_ENDPOINT=https://0b33a03b5c993fd2f453379dc36558e5.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
# Public domain for accessing the bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_DOMAIN=https://s3-for-lobechat.your-domain.com
```

### Obtain S3 Key Environment Variables

You need to obtain the access key for S3 so that the LobeChat server has permission to access the S3 storage service. In R2, you can configure the access key in the account details:

<Image
  alt={'View Access Key for Bucket'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/be0c95c0-6693-44ee-a490-7e8dfaa8b34d'}
></Image>

Click the button in the upper right corner to create an API token, then enter the API Token creation page.

<Image
  alt={'Create Corresponding API Token'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/7b0ea46c-5157-40a8-888f-f47664a4884f'}
></Image>

Since our server-side database needs to read and write to the S3 storage service, the permissions need to be set to read and write, and only select the bucket we created, then click create.

<Image
  alt={'Configure API Token Permissions'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/d6f5a918-7b50-4d6e-83a6-3894ab930ddf'}
></Image>

After creation, you can see the corresponding S3 API token.

<Image
  alt={'Copy API Token'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/763b18f9-2b5f-44bb-a479-9b56d46f7397'}
></Image>

The corresponding environment variables are:

```shell
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=9998d6757e276cf9f1edbd325b7083a6
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=55af75d8eb6b99f189f6a35f855336ea62cd9c4751a5cf4337c53c1d3f497ac2
```

### Add the Corresponding Environment Variables in Vercel

The steps to obtain the required environment variables may vary for different S3 service providers, but the obtained environment variables should be consistent in the end:

```shell
# S3 Key
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=9998d6757e276cf9f1edbd325b7083a6
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=55af75d8eb6b99f189f6a35f855336ea62cd9c4751a5cf4337c53c1d3f497ac2

# Bucket name
S3_BUCKET=lobechat
# Bucket request endpoint
S3_ENDPOINT=https://0b33a03b5c993fd2f453379dc36558e5.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
# Public domain for accessing the bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_DOMAIN=https://s3-for-lobechat.your-domain.com

# Bucket region, such as us-west-1, generally not required to add, but some service providers may need to configure
# S3_REGION=us-west-1
```

Then enter the above environment variables into Vercel's environment variables:

<Image
  alt={'Add S3 Environment Variables in Vercel'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/cd74152d-0ae8-44fd-b815-3307c56a3c18'}
></Image>

### Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Since S3 storage services are often on a separate domain, cross-origin access needs to be configured.

In R2, you can find the CORS configuration in the settings of the storage bucket:

<Image
  alt={'Cloudflare R2 CORS Settings'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/ab008be7-26b2-4b78-8bd9-24301bf34d23'}
></Image>

Add a CORS rule to allow requests from your domain (in this case, `https://your-project.vercel.app`):

<Image
  alt={'Configure Allowed Site Domain'}
  src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/dfcc2cb3-2958-4498-a8a4-51bec584fe7d'}
></Image>

Example configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-project.vercel.app"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "HEAD", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"]
  }
]
```

After configuration, click save.

</Steps>

## 4. Deployment and Verification

After completing the above steps, the configuration of the server database should be done. Next, we can deploy LobeChat to Vercel and then visit your Vercel link to verify if the server database is working correctly.

<Steps>
  ### Redeploy the latest commit

After configuring the environment variables, you need to redeploy the latest commit and wait for the deployment to complete.

<Image
