# Supporting TTS & STT Voice Conversations

LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, allowing our application to transform textual information into clear voice output. Users can interact with our conversational agents as if they were talking to a real person. There are various voice options for users to choose from, providing the right audio source for their assistant. Additionally, for those who prefer auditory learning or seek to gain information while on the go, TTS offers an excellent solution.

In LobeChat, we have carefully curated a selection of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to cater to users from different regions and cultural backgrounds. Users can select suitable voices based on personal preferences or specific scenarios, thus achieving a personalized communication experience.
