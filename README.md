## ✨ Features

Today’s agents are one-off, task-driven tools. They lack context, live in isolation, and require manual hand-offs between different windows and models. While some maintain memory, it is often global, shallow, and impersonal. In this mode, users are forced to toggle between fragmented conversations, making it difficult to form structured productivity.

**LobeHub changes everything.**

LobeHub is a work-and-lifestyle space to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you. In LobeHub, we treat **Agents as the unit of work**, providing an infrastructure where humans and agents co-evolve.

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89d1c402-a62b-4794-82ea-17e5ee1a6165)

### Operator: Agents as the Unit of Work

Hires, schedules, and reports on your entire AI team.

- **More productivity. Fewer tools**: Bring all your agents under one roof.
- **IM Gateway**: Agents where you already chat.

### Evolve: Co-evolution of Humans and Agents

The best AI is one that understands you deeply. LobeHub features **Personal Memory** that builds a clear understanding of your needs.

- **Continual Learning**: Your agents learn from how you work, adapting their behavior to act at the right moment.
- **White-Box Memory**: We believe in transparency. Your agents use structured, editable memory, giving you full control over what they remember.

## 🛳 Self Hosting

LobeHub provides Self-Hosted Version with Vercel, Alibaba Cloud, and [Docker Image][docker-release-link]. This allows you to deploy your own chatbot within a few minutes without any prior knowledge.

> \[!TIP]
>
> Learn more about [📘 Build your own LobeHub][docs-self-hosting] by checking it out.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel, Zeabur , Sealos or Alibaba Cloud

"If you want to deploy this service yourself on Vercel, Zeabur or Alibaba Cloud, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

<div align="center">

|           Deploy with Vercel            |                     Deploy with Zeabur                      |                     Deploy with Sealos                      |                       Deploy with RepoCloud                       |                         Deploy with Alibaba Cloud                         |

</div>

#### After Fork

After fork, only retain the upstream sync action and disable other actions in your repository on GitHub.

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

> \[!TIP]
>
> We suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [📘 Auto Sync With Latest][docs-upstream-sync]

<br/>

### `B` Deploying with Docker

[![][docker-release-shield]][docker-release-link]
[![][docker-size-shield]][docker-size-link]
[![][docker-pulls-shield]][docker-pulls-link]

We provide a Docker image for deploying the LobeHub service on your own private device. Use the following command to start the LobeHub service:

1. create a folder to for storage files

### Environment Variable

This project provides some additional configuration items set with environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                               | Example                                                                                                              |

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The complete list of environment variables can be found in the [📘 Environment Variables][docs-env-var]

### Obtain OpenAI API Key

An API Key is required to chat with LLMs in LobeHub. This section uses the OpenAI model provider as an example to briefly introduce how to obtain an API Key.

#### `A` Via the Official OpenAI Channel

- Sign up for an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup); you will need an international phone number and a non-mainland-China email address;
- After signing up, go to the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) page and click `Create new secret key` to create a new API Key:

| Step 1: Open the creation dialog                                                                                                                   | Step 2: Create the API Key                                                                                                                         | Step 3: Get the API Key                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/28616219/296253192-ff2193dd-f125-4e58-82e8-91bc376c0d68.png" height="200"/> | <img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/28616219/296254170-803bacf0-4471-4171-ae79-0eab08d621d1.png" height="200"/> | <img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/28616219/296255167-f2745f2b-f083-4ba8-bc78-9b558e0002de.png" height="200"/> |

- Fill this API Key into the LobeHub API Key configuration and you are ready to go.

> \[!TIP]
>
> Newly registered accounts usually come with a $5 free credit, but it is only valid for three months.
> If you want to keep using your API Key long-term, you need to bind a credit card to complete payment. Since OpenAI only supports foreign-currency credit cards, you will need to find a suitable payment channel yourself, which is not covered in detail here.

<br/>

#### `B` Via an OpenAI Third-Party Proxy

If you find signing up for an OpenAI account or binding a foreign-currency credit card troublesome, you can consider using a well-known OpenAI third-party proxy to obtain an API Key, which can effectively lower the barrier to getting one. At the same time, however, once you use a third-party service, you may also need to bear its potential risks — please decide based on your own actual situation. Below is a list of common third-party model proxies for your reference:

|                                                                     | Provider     | Features                                                                                                | Proxy URL                 | Link                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| <img src="https://resource.aihubmix.com/logo.png?v=1" width="48" /> | **AIHubMix** | Uses the OpenAI enterprise API; all models site-wide at **14% off** the official price (incl. GPT-5.6 and Claude Fable 5) | `https://aihubmix.com/v1` | [Get](https://console.aihubmix.com/token?aff=8DBz) |

> \[!WARNING]
>
> **Disclaimer**: The OpenAI API Keys recommended here are provided by third-party proxies, so we are not responsible for the **validity** or **security** of these API Keys. Please bear the risks of purchasing and using them yourself.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are a model service provider and believe your service is stable enough and reasonably priced, feel free to contact us — we will consider recommending it after trying and testing it ourselves.
