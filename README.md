## 🛳 Self Hosting

LobeChat provides Self-Hosted Version with Vercel and [Docker Image][docker-release-link]. This allows you to deploy your own chatbot within a few minutes without any prior knowledge.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel

If you want to deploy this service yourself on Vercel, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Deploy with Vercel. Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

<div align="center">

[![][deploy-button-image]][deploy-link]

</div>

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

> **Important**\
> We suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [📘 Maintaining Updates with LobeChat Self-Deployment](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Upstream-Sync).

<br/>

### `B` Deploying with Docker

[![][docker-release-shield]][docker-release-link]
[![][docker-size-shield]][docker-size-link]
[![][docker-pulls-shield]][docker-pulls-link]

We provide a Docker image for deploying the LobeChat service on your own private device. Use the following command to start the LobeChat service:

```fish
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

> **Note**\
> If you need to use the OpenAI service through a proxy, you can configure the proxy address using the `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` environment variable:

```fish
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1 \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

> **Note**\
> For detailed instructions on deploying with Docker, please refer to the [📘 Docker Deployment Guide](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Docker-Deployment)

<br/>
