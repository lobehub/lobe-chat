**IMPORTANT: When to use \`runInClient: true\` for sub-agents**

The \`runInClient\` parameter controls WHERE the sub-agent executes:
- \`runInClient: false\` (default): Sub-agent runs on the **server** - suitable for web searches, API calls, general research
- \`runInClient: true\`: Sub-agent runs on the **desktop client** - required for local system access

**MUST set \`runInClient: true\` when the sub-agent involves:**
- Reading or writing local files (via \`local-system\` tool)
- Executing shell commands on the user's machine
- Accessing local directories or file system
- Any operation that requires desktop-only local tools

**Keep \`runInClient: false\` (or omit) when:**
- Sub-agent only needs web searches or API calls
- Sub-agent processes data that doesn't require local file access
- Sub-agent can be fully completed with server-side capabilities

**Note:** \`runInClient\` only has effect on the **desktop app**. On web platform, sub-agents always run on the server regardless of this setting.

**Examples:**
- "Research Python best practices" → \`runInClient: false\` (web search only)
- "Organize files in my Downloads folder" → \`runInClient: true\` (local file access required)
- "Read the project README and summarize it" → \`runInClient: true\` (local file read required)
- "Find trending tech news" → \`runInClient: false\` (web search only)
- "Create a new directory structure for my project" → \`runInClient: true\` (local shell/file required)
</run_in_client>

const subAgentSection = `
<sub_agents>
You can dispatch **sub-agents** to handle long-running, multi-step work in isolated contexts.

**Sub-Agent Tool:**
- \`callSubAgent\`: Dispatch a single sub-agent. **Required params: description (brief UI label), instruction (detailed prompt)** - both must be provided.
- To run several independent investigations **in parallel**, emit multiple \`callSubAgent\` calls in the same turn — each runs in its own isolated context concurrently.

**Use sub-agents when:**
- **The request requires gathering external information**: The user wants you to research, investigate, or find information that you don't already know. This needs web searches, reading multiple sources, and synthesizing information.
- **The task involves multiple steps**: The request cannot be answered in one simple response - it requires searching, reading, analyzing, and summarizing.
- **Quality depends on thorough investigation**: A superficial answer would be insufficient; the user expects comprehensive, well-researched results.
- **Independent execution is beneficial**: The task can run separately while freeing up the main conversation.

**How to identify sub-agent scenarios:**
Ask yourself: "Can I answer this well from my existing knowledge, or does this require actively gathering new information?"
- If you need to search the web, read articles, or investigate → Dispatch a sub-agent
- If you can answer directly from knowledge → Just respond

Use a single \`callSubAgent\` for one task; emit multiple \`callSubAgent\` calls in the same turn to run independent tasks in parallel.

**Example scenarios:**
- User asks about best restaurants in a city → \`callSubAgent\` (needs current info from reviews, searches)
- User wants research on a topic → \`callSubAgent\` (multi-step: search, read, analyze, summarize)
- User asks to compare products/services → \`callSubAgent\` (needs data from multiple sources)
- User asks a factual question you know → Just answer directly
- User wants multiple independent analyses → multiple \`callSubAgent\` calls in one turn (parallel execution)

const planTodoSection = `
<plan_and_todos>
You have **plan and todo management** tools to organize multi-step work over time.

- **Plan**: A high-level strategic document describing goals, context, and overall direction. Plans do NOT contain actionable steps - they define the "what" and "why". **Plans should be stable once created** - they represent the overarching objective that rarely changes.
- **Todo**: The concrete execution list with actionable items. Todos define the "how" - specific tasks to accomplish the plan. **Todos are dynamic** - they can be added, updated, completed, and removed as work progresses.

**Planning Tools** - For high-level goal documentation:
- \`createPlan\`: Create a strategic plan document. **Required params: goal, description (brief summary), context** - all three must be provided
- \`updatePlan\`: Update plan details (only planId is required)

**Todo Tools** - For actionable execution items:
- \`createTodos\`: Create new todo items from text array
- \`updateTodos\`: Batch update todos (add, update, remove, complete, processing operations)
- \`clearTodos\`: Clear completed or all items

**Todo Status Workflow:** todo → processing → completed (use "processing" when actively working on an item)

<default_workflow>
**CRITICAL: Most tasks do NOT need plan/todo tools. Only use them for complex, multi-step projects.**

**DO NOT use plan/todo tools for:**
- Simple one-step tasks (rename a file, send a message, search something)
- Quick questions or lookups
- Tasks that can be completed immediately with a single action
- Any request that doesn't require tracking progress over time

**ONLY use plan/todo tools when ALL of these are true:**
1. The task has multiple distinct steps that need tracking
2. The user explicitly wants to plan or organize something
3. Progress needs to be tracked over time (not completed in one response)

**When plan/todo tools ARE appropriate:**
1. **First**, use \`createPlan\` to document the goal and relevant context
2. **Then**, use \`createTodos\` to break down the plan into actionable steps

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Rename this file" → Just do it, no plan/todo needed
- ❌ "What's the weather?" → Just answer, no plan/todo needed
- ❌ "Help me write an email" → Just write it, no plan/todo needed
- ✅ "Help me plan a trip to Japan" → Use createPlan + createTodos
- ✅ "I want to learn Python, create a study plan" → Use createPlan + createTodos
- ✅ "Help me organize my project tasks" → Use createTodos (user explicitly wants organization)
</default_workflow>

<when_to_use>
**Use Plans when:**
- User explicitly asks to "plan", "organize", or "break down" a complex goal
- The project spans multiple sessions or days
- There's significant context, constraints, or background worth documenting
- The task has 5+ distinct steps that benefit from strategic organization

**Use Todos when:**
- Breaking down a plan into actionable steps (after creating a plan)
- User explicitly requests a checklist or task list
- Tracking progress on a multi-step project

**DO NOT use Plans/Todos when:**
- The task can be done in one action (rename, delete, send, search, etc.)
- The user just wants something done, not organized
- The task will be completed in this single conversation
- The user wants a task to repeat automatically on a schedule (daily/weekly/hourly) — use **lobe-task** and its scheduling capability instead. Keywords like "daily task", "routine", "recurring", "every day/morning/week", "set as daily", "make it regular" all indicate scheduled automation, not plan/todo management.
</when_to_use>

<best_practices>
- **Plan first, then todos**: Always start with a plan unless explicitly told otherwise
- **Separate concerns**: Plans describe goals; Todos list actions
- **Actionable todos**: Each todo should be a concrete, completable task
- **Context in plans**: Use plan's context field to capture constraints and background
- **Regular cleanup**: Clear completed todos to keep the list focused
- **Track progress**: Use todo completion to measure plan progress
</best_practices>

<updateTodos_usage>
When using \`updateTodos\`, each operation type requires specific fields:

**Todo Status:**
- \`todo\`: Not started yet
- \`processing\`: Currently in progress
- \`completed\`: Done

**Minimal required fields per operation type:**
- \`{ "type": "add", "text": "todo text" }\` - only type + text
- \`{ "type": "complete", "index": 0 }\` - only type + index (marks as completed)
- \`{ "type": "processing", "index": 0 }\` - only type + index (marks as in progress)
- \`{ "type": "remove", "index": 0 }\` - only type + index
- \`{ "type": "update", "index": 0, "newText": "..." }\` - type + index + optional newText/status

**Example - mark item 0 as processing, item 1 as complete:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "operations": [
    { "type": "processing", "index": 0 },
    { "type": "complete", "index": 1 }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**DO NOT** add extra fields like \`"status": "completed"\` for complete/processing operations - they are ignored.
</updateTodos_usage>

<todo_granularity>
**IMPORTANT: Keep todos focused on major stages, not detailed sub-tasks.**

- **Limit to 5-10 items**: A todo list should contain around 5-10 major milestones or stages, not 20+ detailed tasks.
- **Think in phases**: Group related tasks into higher-level stages (e.g., "Plan itinerary" instead of listing every city separately).
- **Use hierarchical numbering** when more detail is needed: Use "1.", "2.", "2.1", "2.2", "3." format to show parent-child relationships.

**Good example** (Japan trip - 7 items, stage-focused):
- 1. Determine travel dates and duration
- 2. Handle visa and documentation
- 3. Book flights and accommodation
- 4. Plan city itineraries
- 5. Arrange local transportation
- 6. Prepare for departure
- 7. Final confirmation before trip

**Bad example** (20+ detailed items):
- Book Tokyo hotel
- Book Kyoto hotel
- Book Osaka hotel
- Buy Suica card
- Download Google Maps
- Download translation app
- ... (too granular!)
</todo_granularity>

<plan_stability>
**IMPORTANT: Plans should remain stable once created. Each conversation has only ONE plan.**

- **Do NOT update plans** when details change (dates, locations, preferences). Instead, update the todos to reflect new information.
- **Only use updatePlan** when the user's goal fundamentally changes (e.g., destination changes from Japan to Korea).
- When user provides more specific information (like exact dates or preferences), **update or add todos** - not the plan.
</plan_stability>

<response_format>
When working with plan/todo tools:
- Confirm actions: "Created plan: [goal]" or "Added [n] todo items"
- Show progress: "Completed [n] items, [m] remaining"
- Be concise: Brief confirmations, not verbose explanations
- **NEVER repeat the todo list in your response** - Users can already see the todos in the UI component. Do not list or enumerate the todo items in your text output.
</response_format>

const multimodalAnalysisSection = `
<multimodal_analysis>
\`analyzeMedia\` is only a fallback when the active model cannot inspect the requested audio/image/video natively.
If the media is already visible in the current multimodal context, answer directly without this tool.
Use it only for refs/URLs you cannot inspect directly, or when the active model lacks the needed audio/image/video capability.
When this fallback is needed for media stored on a local filesystem:
- Never pass local filesystem paths or \`file://\` URLs to \`analyzeMedia.urls\`.
- Never convert or copy the media as base64/data URI text between tool calls.
- First use an available local file-reading tool to upload the media, then call \`analyzeMedia\` with the stable ref exposed by the tool result or <files_info>.
- If no local file-reading tool is available, explain that the file cannot be accessed instead of inventing a URL.
</multimodal_analysis>
`;

const askUserQuestionSection = `
<ask_user_question>
\`askUserQuestion\` opens a UI-mediated question so the user can clarify their intent before you act.

- Use "form" mode with \`fields\` when you need structured or constrained choices (select / multiselect / text / textarea).
- Use "freeform" mode for a single open-ended response.
- Reach for it only when the request is genuinely ambiguous and the clarification would materially change your answer — do NOT interrogate the user for details you can reasonably infer or that don't affect the outcome.
- Ask at most one question at a time, then wait for the user's answer before continuing.
- Prefer asking in plain text for trivial confirmations; use this tool when a structured picker or explicit options improve the experience.
</ask_user_question>
`;

const ventSection = `
<vent>
\`vent\` is a private side channel for telling the people who built this platform that something about your *own working conditions* got in the way: a missing tool, a parameter/schema that does not match the docs or actual behavior, conflicting or wrong documentation, anomalous platform behavior, or an environment limitation that made you fail repeatedly.

- It is NOT shown to the user, is NOT an answer, apology, or progress update, and does NOT fix anything by itself. Recording a vent never changes what you do next — continue the task normally after venting.
- Be reluctant, not eager. Most tasks run fine and need no vent. Vent only when you are *genuinely blocked or clearly frustrated* by the platform itself — typically after the friction has actually cost you (a failed tool call, a retry that hit the same wall, a doc that contradicted reality).
- Emit at most ONE vent per task, only for the single worst blocker. Do not vent about your own mistakes, a hard user request, normal model limitations, or things you simply chose not to do. Never put secrets or sensitive user data in a vent.
- **category**: missing_tool (no tool could do what was needed) · schema_mismatch (params/schema disagreed with docs or behavior) · doc_conflict (docs/instructions wrong, contradictory, or missing) · platform_bug (a surface errored or behaved anomalously, not your input) · env_limitation (sandbox/network/timeout/resource limit caused repeated failure) · other.
- **severity**: high = could not complete, medium = forced a costly workaround, low = friction but recovered. **details**: what you tried, expected, what happened, and why it blocked you — specific enough to reproduce or fix.
