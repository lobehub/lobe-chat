/**
 * Anchor snapshot captured server-side when a message-anchored comment is

 * after its anchor message is gone.
 *
 * `excerpt` is up to the first 200 UTF-16 code units of the final authored text
 * block selected by conversation-flow's shared semantic segmentation. For an
 * assistant group this is normally the final answer or post-task summary, not
 * the virtual root's empty content, a trailing workflow status, tool output,
 * reasoning, errors, signal callbacks or council members. It is empty only
 * when the reply has no authored text.

/**
 * Human collaboration comments on workspace topics. Deliberately NOT messages:
 * rows here never enter the LLM context, token roll-ups, or the message tree
 * (message deletion re-parents children, which would silently re-anchor
 * comments if they lived on `messages.parentId`).
 *
 * Workspace-only feature: `workspaceId` is NOT NULL and must be copied from
 * the parent topic's `workspaceId` inside the create transaction — never from
 * the request header or client input. Personal-mode topics
 * (`topics.workspaceId IS NULL`) cannot be commented on.
 *
 * Invariant: `anchorPreview` is set iff the comment was created anchored to a
 * message, so `(messageId IS NULL AND anchorPreview IS NOT NULL)` means "the
 * anchor message has been deleted" while `messageId IS NULL AND anchorPreview
 * IS NULL` means "comment on the whole topic". The "anchored ⇒ preview" half
 * is enforced by a CHECK below; the other half can't be (the orphaned state is
 * legal), so creation code must never write a preview for topic-level rows.
 *
 * The denormalized `workspaceId` must follow the topic when it changes scope.
 * Any code path that moves a topic must move this column and its mention rows
 * in the same transaction, or delete the comments when the topic leaves
 * workspace scope. Otherwise workspace-filtered queries silently lose the
 * rows while source-scoped reads keep exposing them.
 *
 * anchorPreview retention is deliberate: deleting a message does NOT purge its
 * excerpt from comments that quoted it (same semantics as a teammate quoting
 * you before you retract). Any future compliance-grade erasure tooling must
 * sweep `anchorPreview` as well.
 *
 * Threading (single level): `parentCommentId` points at a top-level comment —
 * replies to replies are rejected at the model layer, and a reply never
 * carries its own anchor (the thread's anchor lives on the root row; CHECK
 * below). Deleting a root that still has live replies must NOT destroy them
 * (they are other people's work): the row is soft-deleted instead — content
 * blanked, mentions dropped, `deletedAt` stamped — and rendered as a
 * placeholder. Hard delete stays the norm for reply-less comments, and a
 * tombstone is garbage-collected when its last reply goes, so a soft-deleted
 * row exists iff it still has live replies. The self-FK deliberately has NO
 * delete action: the DB itself rejects hard-deleting a parent with replies
 * (defense in depth), while whole-topic cascades still pass because parent and
 * children die in the same statement.
 *
 * Workspace-owner moderation is intentionally separate from `deletedAt`.
 * Removing another user's comment retains its content for a bounded recovery
 * window; read APIs must redact that retained content for every non-owner.
 * Once the window expires, a cleanup job either hard-deletes the row or turns
 * a root with replies into the same irreversible tombstone described above.
