 *
 * Before PR #16420, `lobe-agent-management`'s self-management prompt could make the builder
 * mistake an ambiguous "update this" request for editing itself instead of the target agent.
 * Depending on caller (browser client tool executor vs. gateway server runtime in
 * `apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/serverRuntimes/agentBuilder.ts`), these fields can
 * arrive through *either* `AgentModel.update()` or `updateConfig()` — e.g. the gateway's
 * `updatePrompt` writes `systemRole` via `update()`, while the browser client's meta editor
 * writes `title`/`avatar`/etc. via `updateConfig()`. So both methods must strip the full list,
 * not just the fields each historically happened to receive. Clients on builds older than
 * PR #16420 can still hit this path, so enforce it here (the single write chokepoint)
