 * The crash is `pg_search`'s (ParadeDB BM25) planner hook, and it fires on any
 * table carrying a `bm25` index: `rt_fetch used out-of-bounds`, SQLSTATE XX000.
 * Drizzle reports it as a bare `Failed query:`, with the real cause only in the
 * driver's `[cause]`. Four properties make it uniquely nasty:
 *
 * - It fires at PLAN time. `EXPLAIN` alone crashes, so a table with zero
 *   matching rows crashes exactly like a full one.
 * - Stock Postgres, PGlite, and any table *without* a bm25 index run these
 *   predicates happily — no test we can write will ever catch it.
 * - It has nothing to do with jsonb. `upper(col) IS NULL` and `(id + 1) IS NULL`
 *   crash identically; the trigger is a null test over a *computed expression*
 *   in a qual. A null test over a bare column is fine.
 * - Only quals crash — WHERE, JOIN ON, HAVING, and the WHERE of a subquery, CTE,
 *   UPDATE or DELETE. SELECT lists, ORDER BY and `UPDATE … SET` targets are safe.
 *
 * `topics` and `messages` carry bm25 indexes today, but so do `agents`, `files`,
 * `documents`, `chat_groups`, `knowledge_bases` and every `user_memories*`
 * table — and that list is one migration away from growing. A predicate written
 * today outlives the index list, so the rule is table-independent: never write
 * the shape.
 *
 * COALESCE the extracted value to a sentinel instead — same semantics, a shape
 * the planner survives:
 *
 * ```sql
 * COALESCE(metadata ->> 'cronJobId', '') = ''                     -- "is null"
 * COALESCE((metadata #>> '{a,b}')::numeric, 0) <= $1              -- numeric gate
 * COALESCE(metadata ->> 'status', '') <> 'done'                   -- IS DISTINCT FROM
 * ```
 *
 * (`IS DISTINCT FROM` measured safe on pg_search 0.15.26, but the guard bans it
 * anyway — it sits one planner-hook change from the crashing family and the
 * COALESCE form costs nothing.)
 *
 * This has now bitten three times: #13040, `getLatestSpineMessageId` (#16693)
 * and `getDueScheduledTopics` (#17077 — the scheduled-run cron crashed on every
 * tick from the day it shipped, so rate-limit continuations never once resumed).
 * `jsonbNullTest.test.ts` is the source-shape guard that holds the line.
