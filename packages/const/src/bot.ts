 * see apps/server/src/services/bot/platforms/attachmentBudget.ts) and the
 * client (which uses them to warn the user in the push modal BEFORE sending).
 *
 * Values are deliberately conservative:
 * - telegram: 5MB photo / 20MB file — Bot API caps for URL-sourced media.
 * - discord: 10MB — default upload cap for bots (DMs never get guild boosts).
 * - slack: 50MB — `files.upload` v2 itself allows 1GB, but every sender
 *   materializes the file in memory to upload it, so the real ceiling is
 *   MAX_IN_MEMORY_ATTACHMENT_BYTES. Budgeting at 1GB made the 50MB–1GB band
 *   pass the budget pass as an upload and then fail during materialization,
 *   dropping the attachment with neither a file nor a download link.
 * - wechat: 2MB image — empirical: iLink silently drops larger images
 *   (every API call returns 200 yet the message never renders); 20MB file
 *   as a best-effort cap, the iLink protocol documents no explicit number.
 *
 * `textMaxChars` is the single-message character cap used to batch the
 * download-link fallbacks: Discord rejects a message over 2000 chars,
 * Telegram truncates at 4096 (which would cut a URL in half), Slack's
 * practical `chat.postMessage` limit is ~3000, and iLink documents none —
 * so WeChat reuses Discord's conservative number.
