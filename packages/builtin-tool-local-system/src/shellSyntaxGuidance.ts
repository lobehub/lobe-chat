/**
 * Per-shell syntax guidance for the `{{shellSyntaxGuidance}}` placeholder in
 * the local-system system role, so the model only ever sees instructions for
 * the shell `runCommand` actually spawns. The previous prompt always carried
 * the PowerShell 5.1 guidance, which anchored models into emitting PowerShell
 * commands even when the user had selected Git Bash.
 *
 * Matching is by the human-readable shell names produced by `getShellInfo()`
 * in `@lobechat/local-file-shell` ("Git Bash", "PowerShell 7+ (pwsh)",
 * "Windows PowerShell 5.1", "cmd.exe", "/bin/sh") — that display name is what
 * both the renderer context and the device system-info report carry. Keep the
 * two in sync when adding a shell.
