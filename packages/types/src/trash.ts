 * literal here plus a handler in the server `TrashService` — never a new
 * table.
 *
 * The first slice covers the chat domain. Resource-domain support is added by
 * the workspace Resource recycle-bin slice without removing those literals.
 *
 * Only *root* kinds are user-visible in the recycle bin. Rows that were
 * trashed as part of a parent's cascade (e.g. a topic under a trashed agent or
 * a document under a trashed folder) are still registered as `trash_items`
 * children so a restore / purge of the root can find them, but the UI never
 * lists them on their own.
