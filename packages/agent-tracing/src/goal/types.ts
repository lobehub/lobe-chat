/**
 * Goal trajectory — the same trace format as {@link ExecutionSnapshot}, one
 * level up.
 *
 * An operation is one complete agent execution and gets one `ExecutionSnapshot`
 * whose steps are LLM/tool calls. A goal is one complete *goal* execution and
 * gets one `GoalTrajectory` whose steps are advances. The nesting closes at the
 * leaf: an advance dispatches a task run, that run is an operation, and its
 * `operationId` is recorded here rather than its content copied — so
 * `agent-tracing inspect <opId>` continues from where the goal trace stops.
 *
 * Graph entities are typed structurally instead of importing `@lobechat/types`,
 * matching how `StepSnapshot.messages` stays loose: a trace format has to keep
 * reading objects written by older code.
