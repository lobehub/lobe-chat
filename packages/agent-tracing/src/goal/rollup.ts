 * recorded graph state either way, so folding them forward sees both
 * transitions without the coordinator having to cooperate.
 *
 * Waiting time is measured between the tick that first saw the gate open and
 * the tick that first saw it answered. That is the wall time the goal actually
 * stood still — it starts when the coordinator stopped, not when the row was
 * written, and it ends when the coordinator noticed, not when the person
 * clicked. Both boundaries are what the goal experienced.
