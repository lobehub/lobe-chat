# Structured Report Rounds (`lh acceptance run ingest`)

Per-criterion `result submit` (SKILL.md Step 3) assumes a verify plan already
exists. When it doesn't — a standalone delivery, or any run where **you** author
the checks, which is the usual case — publish a **structured report round**
instead: a self-contained directory that
`lh acceptance run ingest` uploads as one immutable verification round. The
acceptance page renders itself from `result.json`: provenance, the overall
conclusion, and the check list from `plan[]` paired with `cases[]`, each with
its evidence inline — **images render as figures, before/after pairs render
under tinted comparison bands**. A chat-only summary or a bare markdown report
never gets that rendering; the structured round does.

## Contents

- [No operation ID needed](#no-operation-id-needed)
- [Directory layout](#directory-layout)
- [Workflow](#workflow)
- [result.json schema](#resultjson-schema)
- [Rules](#rules)

Rule of thumb: **plan exists → per-criterion submit; you author the checks →
structured round ingest.** Never mix both for the same delivery round.

## No operation id needed

`--operation` is optional on every command in this skill. Without one, author
the checks and use one of these first-class paths:

A round is immutable, so **allocate a fresh directory before every ingest** —
never point a second ingest at a directory you already published:

```bash
# $1 = subject key (see Directory layout), $2 = a short slug for this round.
new_round() {
  dir=".acceptances/$1/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$2"
  mkdir -p "$dir/assets" && printf '%s' "$dir"
}
```

```bash
# A. first external-project round — creates a standalone acceptance.
# It has no subject yet, so group it under `standalone-<slug>` until the
# returned acceptance id gives the tree its permanent name.
REPORT_DIR=$(new_round standalone-checkout-flow first-pass)
lh acceptance run ingest "$REPORT_DIR" \
  --requirement "<one-sentence business goal>" --json

# Re-verification after a fix — a NEW round on the SAME acceptance.
REPORT_DIR=$(new_round standalone-checkout-flow repair)
lh acceptance run ingest "$REPORT_DIR" --acceptance "$ACCEPTANCE_ID" --json

# Attach to a subject you were told to use — a Task, Topic, or Document.
# Group the round under that same subject so the tree and the page agree.
REPORT_DIR=$(new_round topic-tpc_xxx first-pass)
lh acceptance run ingest "$REPORT_DIR" --subject topic:tpc_xxx --json

# B. atomic fallback — create the round first, then submit into it with --run
RUN=$(lh acceptance run create --title "…" --goal "…" --json | jq -r .id)
lh acceptance run result submit --run "$RUN" --item "$CHECK_ITEM_ID" …
```

Prefer **A**: per-criterion submits without a plan produce checks with no
declared intent, so the page has nothing to pair the outcome against.

## Directory layout

Rounds live under `.acceptances/`, grouped by the delivery they belong to:

```
.acceptances/
├── .gitignore                     # `*` — the whole tree stays out of git
└── <subject-key>/                 # topic-tpc_x | task-T-12 | document-doc_x
    │                              # standalone-<slug> until an acceptance id exists
    ├── acceptance.json            # which acceptance these rounds belong to
    └── <YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>/  # ONE round — never write into an existing one
        ├── result.json            # THE report — the page renders from this
        ├── report.md              # narrative tail only (verdict, follow-ups, score)
        └── assets/                # evidence referenced from cases[].evidence
```

Three things the shape buys, none of them cosmetic:

- **The subject key mirrors `--subject <type>:<id>`**, so a directory listing
  answers what the acceptance page answers: which delivery is this, and how many
  rounds has it had. A flat `./acceptance-report` answers neither. A standalone
  round has no subject to key on, so group it under `standalone-<slug>` and keep
  every later round of that delivery in the same directory.
- **A round is immutable**, so its directory name carries the timestamp and is
  written once. Re-verification after a fix creates the NEXT directory; reusing
  one silently destroys the evidence a reviewer already decided against.
- **The tree is git-invisible.** `.acceptances/.gitignore` contains `*`, which
  ignores the whole directory including itself, so evidence binaries never land
  as untracked noise and the project's own `.gitignore` is never rewritten.
  `lh acceptance install` and `lh acceptance run ingest` both seed that file, so
  the guarantee does not depend on which entry point a run came through.

Writing a round somewhere else still works — `ingest` takes an explicit path —
but then keeping it out of git is on you.

## Workflow

1. **Write `plan[]` BEFORE you run anything.** Each item is
   `{ id, title, category, verifier, method, expected, requiredEvidence,
supersedes? }`.
   A planned item that never produces a case renders as **未执行** rather than
   vanishing — cut coverage in the open.
   Every item is an outcome the reader can judge — never a programmatic gate
   ([what is not an acceptance check](#what-is-not-an-acceptance-check)).
   **Copy the shapes in this file rather than reconstructing them**: a
   plausible-but-wrong nested shape parses as JSON, is dropped on ingest, and
   the round publishes green with its evidence silently degraded. Read every
   ingest warning as a failed publish.
2. **Collect evidence into `assets/` as you test.** Screenshots must be
   **visually verified with the Read tool before being cited** — never cite an
   image you haven't looked at. For metrics, time series, model or benchmark
   comparisons, distributions, matrices, and tables, use native Acceptance
   structured visualizations: put review-sized values in `cases[].datasets`,
   declare the view in `cases[].visualizations`, and retain the raw CSV/JSON,
   benchmark output, trace, profile, or vectors in `evidence`. Do not generate a
   PNG/GIF when a supported renderer can faithfully express the data. See
   [Structured visualizations](#structured-visualizations).
3. **Fill `cases[]` as you go** — one entry per tested behavior
   (`{ id, name, category, surface, status, observation, evidence }`), reusing
   the plan item's `id`. `status`: `pass` / `fail` / `blocked` (couldn't run —
   a blocked case is not a pass).
4. **Set `title` and `summary.verdict`** (`pass` / `fail` / `partial`) — without
   them the run lists as "未命名验证" with a permanent amber "?" glyph. Write the
   one-paragraph verdict into `summary.conclusion`.
5. **`report.md` is the narrative tail only** — this-round notes, follow-ups,
   score. Do NOT repeat the scope block or a case table; those double up on the
   page. Write it in the language the user is conversing in.
6. **Publish:**

   ```bash
   lh acceptance run ingest "$REPORT_DIR" --source agent-testing --json
   ```

   On the first ingest, add `--requirement "<one-sentence business goal>"`.
   Describe the durable goal of the whole acceptance, not this round's narrower
   implementation scope.

   Grouping needs nothing from you: the command attaches the round to the
   conversation it was invoked from when it can, and otherwise creates a
   standalone acceptance. Pass `--subject` only when you were told which Task,
   Topic, or Document owns the work. To publish a repair into that same history, add
   `--acceptance <acceptanceId>` using the ID printed by the first ingest. The
   command uploads cases + evidence + report body and prints
   `/acceptance/<acceptanceId>` plus its `?r=<roundIndex>` snapshot form —
   the only link the final reply exposes (SKILL.md, Final handoff).

Optional fields: `branch` / `commit` / `pullRequest` (provenance line; when
`branch` is set without `pullRequest`, ingest asks `gh` for the PR),
`summary.score` (0–100, only when the verdict has a subjective component),
`subject` (usually passed via `--subject` instead).

### Structured visualizations

A case containing reviewable structured data should provide `datasets[]` plus
`visualizations[]`. Supported version-1 renderers are `metric-comparison`,
`line-chart`, `bar-chart`, `scatter-plot`, `heatmap`, and `table`. Each
visualization references one dataset by `id` and maps declared fields through
`encoding`.

Inline datasets use declared `fields[]` and object `rows[]`; keep them to a
review-sized summary. Retain raw benchmark results, CSV/JSON, traces, profiles,
and vectors in `evidence`: the visualization is a decision aid, not a replacement
for the audit trail. Do not merely upload a data file and expect Acceptance to
infer a chart; declare both the dataset and visualization explicitly.

Native renderers are the default because they preserve machine-readable values,
accessibility, theme adaptation, and consistent comparison semantics. Generate a
static chart only when none of the supported renderers can faithfully represent
the result, and explain that limitation in the case observation.

Every visualization requires unique non-empty `id`, `type`, `dataset`, and
`version: 1`; `dataset` must reference a declared dataset id. `title` and
`context` are optional non-empty strings. Every encoding field name below must
reference a field declared by that dataset.

| Renderer            | Required encoding                                              | Optional encoding                                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metric-comparison` | `label`, `before`, `after`                                     | `beforeSamples`, `afterSamples`, `direction`, `statistic`, `target`, `unit`               |
| `line-chart`        | `x`, non-empty `series[]`; each series requires `field`        | series `label`, series `style` (`muted` \| `primary` \| `accent`), `xLabel`, `yLabel`     |
| `bar-chart`         | `category`, non-empty `series[]`; each series requires `field` | series `label`, `valueLabel`                                                              |
| `scatter-plot`      | `x`, `y`                                                       | `color`, `label`, `xLabel`, `yLabel`                                                      |
| `heatmap`           | `x`, `y`, `value`                                              | none                                                                                      |
| `table`             | none; `encoding` itself may be omitted                         | non-empty `columns[]`; `highlights[]` entries require `field` and `mode` (`min` \| `max`) |

One shape for every renderer — `id`, `type`, `version: 1`, `dataset`, and an
`encoding` whose field names are keys of that dataset (see the `line-chart`
below; the other types differ only in the encoding keys listed above):

```json
{
  "dataset": "training",
  "encoding": {
    "x": "step",
    "series": [
      { "field": "baselineLoss", "label": "Baseline", "style": "muted" },
      { "field": "candidateLoss", "label": "Candidate", "style": "primary" }
    ],
    "xLabel": "Step",
    "yLabel": "Loss"
  },
  "id": "loss-over-time",
  "type": "line-chart",
  "version": 1
}
```

Dataset field `type` is one of `boolean`, `category`, `number`, `string`, or
`temporal`; field keys and dataset/view ids must be unique. Rows may contain only
declared keys with string, number, boolean, or null values. The combined inline
row limit is 10,000.

### Closed vocabularies — the pipeline acts on these, they are not labels

| field                           | values                                                                                                | what it does                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verifier`                      | `program` \| `agent` \| `llm` (default `agent`)                                                       | How the verdict is reached. A command-asserted check is `program`; calling it `agent` hides what actually judged it. |
| `requiredEvidence`              | `screenshot` \| `gif` \| `video` \| `audio` \| `text` \| `markdown` \| `dom_snapshot` \| `transcript` | The artifact this check **must** produce. The coverage gate **fails** an item whose required medium is missing.      |
| `surfaces` / per-case `surface` | `web` \| `desktop` \| `cli` \| `mobile` \| `bot` (`electron` → `desktop`)                             | The product surface a check ran **on**. A test kind (`unit`, `backend`) or runtime mode is not a surface.            |

`category` names the user-facing requirement area (e.g. `Task hierarchy`,
`Rate-limit recovery`) — never a technical surface. `method` / `expected` stay
free prose; they render under the check next to the outcome.

### What is not an acceptance check

The repo's own gates — tests, coverage, `type-check`, lint, format, a clean
build, "CI passes" — are never `plan[]` / `cases[]` items, under any phrasing;
they are one line in `report.md` under **Verification**. Ingest drops matching
items (matched on title, category, AND `method`), warns, and recounts `summary`;
a gates-only round fails to publish. Full rule: SKILL.md.

### Before/after comparison pairs

The page renders a complete pair under tinted bands (red `before`, green
`after`). Both halves need the same string `id`; use `layout: "horizontal"` for
a left/right comparison and `layout: "vertical"` for a top/bottom comparison.
When omitted, `layout` defaults to `horizontal`. Add a `label` stating the
measured delta on each side:

```json
"evidence": [
  { "path": "assets/before.png",
    "comparison": { "id": "topic-row", "role": "before", "layout": "horizontal", "label": "before: 11px" } },
  { "path": "assets/after.png",
    "comparison": { "id": "topic-row", "role": "after", "layout": "horizontal", "label": "after: 12px" } }
]
```

Choose the layout by comparison intent, not by the source image dimensions:

- `horizontal` — before on the left, after on the right. Use it when the reader
  should compare the same region across two versions at a glance. This is the
  normal choice for full-page or full-window before/after screenshots.
- `vertical` — before on top, after below. Use it when preserving each image's
  full width matters more than simultaneous scanning, such as a very wide,
  shallow toolbar or timeline strip.

A comparison pair means the same view in two states — sequential steps of a
flow are ordinary ordered evidence with captions, not a pair.

## Rules

- **No evidence, no claim** — every `pass`/`fail` in `cases[]` links at least
  one asset.
- **Non-visual behavioral claims need dual text evidence** — attach a concise
  reviewer-facing reasoning document and a separate audit-facing execution
  artifact containing the exact command/request and observed values. Neither
  unsupported prose nor an unexplained log dump is sufficient.
- **Report failures faithfully** — a failing case with clear evidence is a good
  report; a vague green one is not.
- If coverage was cut, say so in `report.md` — silent truncation reads as
  "covered everything".
