/**
 * Claude Code Adapter
 *
 * Converts Claude Code CLI `--output-format stream-json --verbose` (ndjson)
 * events into unified HeterogeneousAgentEvent[] that the executor feeds into
 * LobeHub's Gateway event handler.
 *
 * Stream-json event shapes (from real CLI output):
 *
 *   {type: 'system', subtype: 'init', session_id, model, ...}
 *   {type: 'assistant', message: {id, content: [{type: 'thinking', thinking}], ...}}
 *   {type: 'assistant', message: {id, content: [{type: 'tool_use', id, name, input}], ...}}
 *   {type: 'user', message: {content: [{type: 'tool_result', tool_use_id, content}]}}
 *   {type: 'assistant', message: {id: <NEW>, content: [{type: 'text', text}], ...}}
 *   {type: 'system', subtype: 'api_retry', api_error_status, attempt, max_attempts, ...}
 *   {type: 'result', is_error, result, ...}
 *   {type: 'rate_limit_event', ...}
 *
 * When the spawn site passes `--include-partial-messages` (desktop driver
 * does, CLI / sandbox runs do not), CC also emits token-level deltas wrapped
 * as:
 *
 *   {type: 'stream_event', event: {type: 'message_start', message: {id, model, ...}}}
 *   {type: 'stream_event', event: {type: 'content_block_delta', index, delta: {type: 'text_delta', text}}}
 *   {type: 'stream_event', event: {type: 'content_block_delta', index, delta: {type: 'thinking_delta', thinking}}}
 *
 * Deltas arrive BEFORE the matching `assistant` event that carries the full
 * content block. We stream the deltas out as incremental chunks and suppress
 * the duplicate emission from `handleAssistant` for any message.id that has
 * already been streamed.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Each content block (thinking / tool_use / text) streams in its OWN assistant event
 * - Multiple events can share the same `message.id` — these are ONE LLM turn
 * - When `message.id` changes, a new LLM turn has begun — new DB assistant message
 * - `tool_result` blocks are in `type: 'user'` events, not assistant events

   *
   * Usage on `raw.message.usage` is also emitted, as a
   * `step_complete{phase:turn_metadata, subagent}` event so the executor
   * can route the per-turn delta onto the subagent's in-thread assistant

   * remains the grand total across main + subagents.
   *
   * Subagent lineage lives as event-level **peer fields** on each chunk

   * Idempotent message-boundary opener called by both `handleAssistant` and
   * `handleStreamEvent(message_start)`. Ensures `stepIndex` advances and
   * `stream_end` / `stream_start(newStep)` fire on the FIRST signal of a new
   * message.id — whether that signal is a delta event or the complete
   * assistant event.
   *
   * - If `started === false`: auto-start (emit stream_start, record id).
   * - If `messageId === currentMessageId`: no-op.
   * - If this is the first message after a system-init stream_start: just
   *   record the id (init already primed the executor).
   * - Otherwise: advance stepIndex and emit stream_end + stream_start(newStep).
